# Job description

You will build new features such as the integration with Kubernetes, Github, Okta, etc., change/fix existing ones such as switching to a different messaging broker for inter-service communication, taking part in product discussions, and even meeting with potential customers and partners (if it's something you would like to do, of course).

## Benefits

* €50,000 to €80,000 annual salary
* Equity - shares/stock options (ESOP) - simulation available during interview

*Bonus*

* Working with up2date tech such as cloud computing, cloud-native apps, and cybersecurity
* The opportunity to have a key role in the early development stage of what we believe will be a landmark product in cloud security
