Identity and Access Management Security

for Cloud

Continuous multi-cloud monitoring for identity and access management (IAM)
                                misconfigurations across all your cloud resources to meet strict IAM compliance
                                directives and improve your cloud security posture.

A powerful Identity Dashboard helping you understand how access is provisioned
                                        in your organization on a per-person basis

Identity provider integration: Onboard your Okta account into Cyscale and get
                                        full visibility on cloud SSO (Single Sign-On) users and provisioning

User access misconfigurations are highlighted so that you can detect and
                                        mitigate cloud computing risk

Easy, granular filtering for: inactive users, highly privileged or high-risk
                                        users, and others

100% Confidence in your Cloud Compliance

Protect sensitive data and comply with strict industry regulations in your
                                        organization. Cyscale automatically runs all critical compliance checks across
                                        multiple public cloud providers such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure and
                                        GCP, and finds data at-risk.

You can either use policy templates as a basis for your custom policies, or
                                        create them from scratch using a smart text editor. Your security team can
                                        control access through IAM policies, IAM roles and other IAM solutions to ensure
                                        a sound identity management program and reduce the attack surface.

Cyscale offers a wide range of benchmarks and frameworks, including: CIS,
                                        ISO27001, PCI-DSS, NIST, SOC2, GDPR, and helps you prepare for auditing.

Onboard teams in 30 minutes and coordinate efforts to apply 500+ out-of-the-box
                                        cybersecurity controls and a large set of policies and standards to prevent data
                                        breaches. From access control, to MFA (multi-factor authentication), and the
                                        principle of least privilege, we help you with regular access reviews for your
                                        cloud infrastructure.
