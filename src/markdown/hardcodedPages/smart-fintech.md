CASE STUDY

Smart Fintech uses Cyscale to gain IAM visibility and ensure cloud security and
                                compliance

Smart Fintech, the first authorized open banking third party provider (TPP) in Romania,
                                seeks to improve its cloud security posture. Cyscale ensures high IAM visibility and a
                                robust alerting mechanism for cloud misconfigurations.

Challenges

Difficulty identifying permission drifts

Manual configurations checks, which slow down the development team

A time-consuming compliance process

Enhanced visibility into users’ roles and privileges

Implementation of a misconfigurations alert system for cloud security

Improved compliance through better IAM visibility and control

Smart Fintech is the first open banking third party provider (TPP) in Romania, authorized by
                            the country’s national bank (NBR). They make full use of cloud infrastructure for their
                            products, that focus on the future of Account2Account Payments and Account Interrogation
                            solutions. Currently, the company develops multiple cloud-native applications to serve their
                            partners and end-customers. In a very dynamic environment, they seek to improve their cloud
                            security posture and protect their customer’s data.

Problem

The company was looking for a solution to help them achieve compliance and ensure their cloud
                        environment is secure. Identity and access management was a focal point for Smart Fintech, since
                        they identified it as a significant risk area. In addition, they needed an alert system for
                        cloud misconfigurations so that they could leverage the development speed promised by the cloud,
                        without compromising on security.

Cyscale is eliminating the need to ask the team for tedious configuration reports,
                                greatly improving our visibility and helping us understand things we didn’t know.

Solution

Cyscale provided Smart Fintech with a comprehensive overview of users’ roles and
                                privileges across multiple cloud accounts. Moreover, using the Cyscale platform, Smart
                                Fintech can identify users that have too many privileges.

, adds Alex.

Cyscale improves the visibility of cloud identities and pinpoints vulnerabilities or
                                misconfigurations through a powerful Identity Dashboard. The platform detects each
                                person in the organization and provides valuable information regarding MFA, privileges
                                and access, making it easy to detect when permissions drift from the expected setup.

The platform helps me with IAM visibility a lot: I can understand who has access and
                                    why. When a person leaves the company, I can detect if their permissions remain
                                    hanging. I don’t have to rely on affirmations that access has been removed, I can
                                    easily see it and confirm it in Cyscale.

Results

The company was able to manage identity and access management effectively, which was one of the
                        focus points when onboarding into Cyscale. As a result, Alex Cociu now confirms that they have
                        the much-needed visibility over users’ permissions.

In addition, after onboarding into Cyscale, the Smart Fintech development team set a goal to
                        achieve zero alerts, which meant ensuring that their cloud environment was always in compliance
                        with their policies. They now know if there are any drifts, and the platform alerts them of
                        deviations from their initial goal.

Moreover, they can adjust the configurations according to acceptable risk by creating exemptions
                        to exclude certain cloud assets.

Conclusion

As Smart Fintech continues to grow, Cyscale is prepared to assist them. Besides IAM and
                        visibility, the platform also provides data security and alerts dashboards, over 400 controls
                        that verify the entire cloud environment, a compliance module, and many others. To read more
