                                        confidentiality and privacy.

Automate cloud security

and SOC 2 compliance

Asset inventory

A multi-cloud asset inventory enables the management of information assets. Easily
                                    filter the asset table and generate relevant inventory reports.

Identity and access management

Detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities related to identities and access and
                                    ensure the implementation of Least Privilege and Separation of Duties. Get alerts on
                                    new findings in your cloud environments.

Encryption

Ensure encryption with strong algorithms is used for data in-transit and at-rest to
                                    provide data protection from cyberattacks.

Logging and monitoring

Make sure that your systems have logs activated and in place, to allow for the
                                    detection of anomalies and security incidents in real-time.

SOC 2 (Service and Organization Controls 2) is a security standard developed by
                                    AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). The standard has 5
                                    Trust Service Criteria (TSC) categories and 64 Trust Service Criteria.
