Powerful

Cloud Native

Security Platform

Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure with Our Advanced Security Platform

Protect your entire stack, from virtual machines to serverless environments, in
                                        any cloud environment. Our powerful platform provides advanced security
                                        features, giving you maximum cloud-native security and peace of mind to
                                        confidently accelerate innovation.

Key Components to

Build a Resilient Cloud

Security Plan

CSPM

Secure multi-cloud environments with Cloud Security Posture Management. Continuous
                                monitoring and remediation across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud. Automate and
                                streamline cloud security management, ensure compliance, and protect sensitive data.

Contextual Analysis

Automatically correlate misconfigurations across compute, storage, and identity assets,
                                determining their real impact on data security. Gain insights to prioritize and
                                streamline remediation efforts, ultimately reducing your organization's exposure to
                                cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

Identity and Access Management

Cloud-Native Application Security (CNAPP)

Automate prevention, detection, and response across the entire cloud-native application
                                lifecycle to enhance security. Ensure secure supply chain, cloud infrastructure, and
                                running workloads, regardless of deployment location. Provide end-to-end security
                                coverage, enabling DevOps teams to build and deploy secure cloud-native applications at
                                scale.

CIEM

Easily review access and track users, access levels, and permissions, including IAM
                                asset misconfigurations. Gain insights into identities and permissions in complex
                                multi-cloud environments, ensuring secure and compliant access management.

CWPP

Enhance your workload security with Cloud Workload Protection Platform. Perform
                                contextual analysis of cloud misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across instances,
                                images, containers, and serverless functions. Ensure complete visibility into your
                                entire app stack, across any cloud environment for better security management.

Container Security

Ensure the security of your container-based apps and cloud infrastructure with Container
                                Security solutions. Gain complete visibility over where containers are running in the
                                cloud and perform a contextual analysis of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations,
                                networking, and access.

Kubernetes Security

Secure your Kubernetes clusters, managed or unmanaged, with complete inventory and
                                continuous scanning for vulnerabilities in cluster components and container images.
                                Detect and remediate potential threats to ensure secure Kubernetes environments for your
                                organization.

with Contextual Analysis

Our Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform provides real-time security
                                        with automated contextual analysis, giving you complete visibility and control
                                        over your cloud environment. By analyzing cloud configuration, workload, and
                                        identity, it identifies the most critical attack vectors that pose a threat to
                                        your business, rather than overwhelming you with numerous alerts for
                                        vulnerabilities, permissions, and exposed services.

With our security tools, you can prioritize and address the most significant
                                        security risks, ensuring application security and the integrity of your cloud
                                        infrastructure. Automations enable continuous scanning for vulnerabilities,
                                        misconfigurations, and threats across your entire cloud ecosystem.

Integrate with all major

Cloud Providers

. You can also use Cyscale for your cloud-native security needs (VMs, network,
                                    serverless, databases, apps) for vulnerability and threat management, cloud
                                    inventory, secure cloud extension, and as a compliance and cost-reduction solution.

With our vulnerability and threat management tools, you can identify and mitigate
                                    security risks before they can be exploited. Our cloud inventory feature provides
                                    complete visibility into your cloud environment, while our secure cloud extension
                                    allows you to securely connect to remote environments.
