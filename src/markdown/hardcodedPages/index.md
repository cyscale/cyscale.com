Leverage the Cloud

with Confidence

Cyscale automates cloud security analysis helping you identify and reduce risk
                                        from misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, improper access control, and data
                                        exposure.

Stay ahead of cloud threats, optimize risk analysis,

and ensure compliance with industry regulations

Cybersecurity specialists across industries rely on Cyscale to eliminate cloud security
                            blindspots, understand the attack surface in their cloud environments and prevent data loss.
                            We help you see through application and cloud infrastructure layers and scale your efforts
                            to organization-wide impact.

Smart Fintech uses Cyscale to gain IAM visibility and ensure cloud security and
                                    compliance

“The platform helps me with IAM visibility a lot: I can understand who has access and
                                why. When a person leaves the company, I can detect if their permissions remain hanging.
                                ”

USE CASE

Get contextual insights

An unpatched virtual machine running an app with the devastating Log4j vulnerability is
                                close to harmless in a private network. However, a server running the same vulnerable
                                cloud app while being exposed to the internet, and having read or write access to a
                                production datastore presents a totally different risk.

Understanding context allows you to immediately see what needs fixing and what can wait,
                                and thus prioritize tasks on your cloud security roadmap.
