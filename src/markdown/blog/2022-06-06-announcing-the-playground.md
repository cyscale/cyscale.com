We are releasing a new feature in Cyscale, [the Playground](https://app.cyscale.com/playground)! It is an application demo that you can access in less than 1 minute. 

Currently, the Playground is populated with data from three cloud vendors: 

* [AWS (Amazon Cloud)](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), 
* [Microsoft Azure,](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) and 
* [Google Cloud.](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) 

We also have integration with [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/), an identity provider. 

In the Playground, you will see a simulation of the infrastructure of a fintech company. However, we believe every company will find something for them there. 

You can observe the following features: 

* controls that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, 
* compliance frameworks and controls associated with them, 
* graph-based visibility of assets, and many more! 

By providing risk scoring, Cyscale can help you prioritize remediation for assets and highlight critical vulnerabilities.

Below, you can find an example of 3 of the [compliance standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) that we support:
