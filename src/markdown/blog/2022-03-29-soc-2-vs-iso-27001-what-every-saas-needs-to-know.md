When looking into consolidating your data protection services, you may decide to implement one of the following two standards:

* SOC 2
* ISO 27001

Acquiring one of these accreditations is a thorough process and choosing the right one for your company is the first step.

**In case you are a SaaS provider** and are not certain which one to choose, keep reading to understand the key differences between them.

**What are these accreditations** and what is their scope?

The SOC 2 and [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) standards are normally acquired by B2B (Business-to-business) companies.
They:

* represent international standards for Information Security Management Systems (ISMSs)
* describe best practices for service providers who manage customer data

As a SaaS, in order to obtain one of the two accreditations, you must implement all the policies of that standard that apply to your organization.

**What do these standards say about your company?**

SOC 2 and ISO 27001 are very similar.
Acquiring one of them promotes the following principles about your organization:

* You recognize the importance of cybersecurity
* Your company is making efforts to mitigate information security risks
* You are properly managing information security

Given the statements above, you can safely assume that a customer will prefer an organization with one of the described accreditations in their possession, to the detriment of one without any.

### A comparison

#### Geographical recognition

* SOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
* ISO 27001 was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB)

#### Duration

* SOC 2: an audit takes **between 3 to 12 months**, depending on the type of audit
* ISO 27001: takes **between 12 to 18 months** to complete

#### Validity duration

* For SOC 2: one year
* For ISO 27001: three years (with surveillance audits once every year)

##### Requirements

**For SOC 2**, you need to fulfill **64 criteria** integrated through five trust service criteria (TSC), as seen below (along with a few criteria examples):

1. Security

   * Contains Security Incidents
   * Communicates Remediation Activities
2. Availability

   * Identify environmental threats
   * Measure Current Usage
3. Processing Integrity

   * Create and maintain records of system inputs
   * Defines processing activities
4. Confidentiality

   * Identify confidential information
   * Destroy confidential information
5. Privacy

   * Use clear and conspicuous language
   * Collect information from reliable sources

**For ISO 27001**, you need to:

1. Implement an ISMS (Information Security Management Systems)
2. Fulfill **7 requirements with 114 suggested controls** divided into 14 sections.

The requirements are described in the following clauses:

* Clause 4: Context of the organization
* Clause 5: Leadership
* Clause 6: Planning
* Clause 7: Support
* Clause 8: Operation
* Clause 9: Performance evaluation
* Clause 10: Improvement

In the Annex of ISO 27001, you can find a list of controls and objectives to help you meet the requirements.

You can find more information [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/).

**Price (of audit)**

* For SOC 2, the cost depends on the type of audit and can range **between $5,000 and $60,000** with an average of about $20,000.
* For ISO 27001, the price of an audit depends on the number of employees in the organization. It can go **as low as $5,400 up to $27,000**.

It is important to note that the price of implementing the standards may significantly increase the total cost of obtaining the accreditation.

One thing to note is that, although SOC 2 and ISO 27001 seem very different, their specifications overlap.

The level of similarity between the requirements of the two depends on:

* The type of business you run
* The scope of the audit

The similarity can be between 53% and 90%, according to AICPA’s mapping to ISO 27001.

Taking into account all of the differences and similarities of the SOC 2 accreditation and the ISO 27001 certification, you can now choose the best standard for your company.

Finally, implementing all the policies required by the described standards can be a difficult and time-consuming task.
