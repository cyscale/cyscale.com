In the paper, you will find: 

* How to encrypt in motion, in use and at rest data, 
* What data classification is and why you should implement it, 
* An in-depth guide to securing your AWS cloud environment from encryption, data loss prevention, to S3 bucket security, 
* Solutions for these problems through cloud security controls and a data security dashboard.
