In the wake of digital transformation, cloud services have emerged as an essential facet of modern business operations. The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds. As businesses move towards these multiple platforms, creating a comprehensive [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) becomes crucial.  

This landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  

## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? 

Cloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: 

* misconfigurations,  
* malware,  
* unauthorized access, and  
* data loss,  

which threaten sensitive data and business continuity. 

Some of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: 

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

This involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: 

* restrict permissions,  
* prevent unauthorized access, and  
* maintain zero-trust principles. 

A few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ "https\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: 

* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, 
* enabling MFA for users, 
* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), 
* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. 

### 2. Data Security 

Protects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ "https\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/"). 

### 3. Workload Protection 

Security controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  

Vulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  

For example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. 

Besides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. 

### 4. Network Security 

This domain utilizes: 

* firewalls,  
* network security groups (NSGs), 
* intrusion detection systems, and  
* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. 

For example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. 

### 5. Incident Response 

This encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. 

Let’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. 

Here’s how an incident response would look like: 

1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  
2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. 
3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. 
4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. 

## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices 

The most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. 

Let's walk through some key practices: 

### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  

A [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ "https\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. 

### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications 

As DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ "https\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. 

### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy 

In multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ "https\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. 

### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  

Adherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ "https\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture.
