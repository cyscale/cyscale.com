We are super excited to reveal that Cyscale – the [platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily](https://cyscale.com/) – has made the longlist for The Europas Awards 2023.  

[The Europas,](https://www.theeuropas.com/) founded by Tech Crunch’s Mike Butcher, has been Europe’s most prestigious startup awards program for the last 15 years and has been instrumental in identifying some of the world’s most ambitious and successful startups, including Spotify, Deliveroo, Wise, and Starling Bank among many others.  

Cyscale entered the awards along with 400 other European startups and has made the cut in the cybersecurity category against five other entrants.  

“It’s great to see Cyscale acknowledged among the Europas nominees as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security,” said Cyscale CEO Ovidiu Cical.  

“Over 400 startups entered these awards and all of them are building their game-changing applications in the cloud. Some companies are even targeting regulated sectors like fintech, healthtech, and insuretech, where security and compliance are critical factors,” Ovidiu added.  

“While the cloud has become the great enabler for these innovations, it’s also the complexity of the cloud that is killing businesses. There are now more controls and configurations than is humanly possible to keep track of, and one mistake – one misconfiguration or vulnerability in your cloud – can cost you your reputation and your business,” he said.  

Cyscale is pioneering the application of cloud security for other startups, scaleups, and SaaS builders by focusing on ease of use and time to value. The CTO or CISO of a startup building out its tech stack doesn’t have the time or the skillset to spend days in every week chasing security alerts.  

So, Cyscale empowers these companies by not only automatically identifying security problems, but also giving the context needed to prioritize remediation and providing guidance on how to fix issues.  

Cyscale is already helping companies secure and monitor their multi-cloud assets and data with our context-driven approach, and we are now looking to harness the power of AI to replace existing security tools with prompts and make an automated and scalable security team available to every cloud-centric company. This recognition by The Europas validates our approach. 

Good luck to all the entrants! You can [cast your vote here](https://www.theeuropas.com/nominees)
