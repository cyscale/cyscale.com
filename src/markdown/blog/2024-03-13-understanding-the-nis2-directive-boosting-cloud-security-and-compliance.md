NIS2 (Network and Information Systems Security Directive 2) is a regulatory framework destined to strengthen cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and service providers. It builds upon the NIS 1 Directive, which regulates network and information systems security. NIS2 was created by the European Union to enforce a modern cybersecurity strategy, having in mind new sectors and improving incident response and resilience in compliant entities. NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) came into effect on the 16th of January 2023 and replaces NIS1, which was released in 2016. 

## Differences between NIS 1 and NIS 2 

Aiming to improve the NIS1 Directive, its newer version has a few differences. Some of the key ones are: 

* NIS2 now covers more sectors than NIS1, which focused on essential services operators in sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare. NIS2 also has cloud computing services in scope. Some examples of the newly added sectors are postal and courier services, waste management, digital providers. 
* Security controls are more stringent for NIS2. A few topics covered for the cloud are data encryption, IAM, vulnerability management, zero trust principles, and incident response. 
* Penalties no longer differ from country to country like they did in NIS1; they are harmonized across the European Union. 

## Key elements of NIS2 

All entities in scope should take measures to cover the most important elements, considered by NIS2 as the baseline for protecting the network, information systems, and physical environment from cybersecurity incidents. The following are the mandatory measures: 

* Policies on risk analysis and information system security, 
* Incident handling, 
* Business continuity, 
* Supply chain security, 
* Security in network and information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance, 
* Policies to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures, 
* Basic cyber hygiene practices and training, 
* Policies regarding the use of cryptography and encryption, 
* HR security, access control policies, access management, 
* The use of MFA or continuous authentication solutions. 

You can find more details about these requirements directly from [the NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). 

The NIS2 is crucial for implementing cybersecurity best practices and protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations can mitigate risks and contribute to a safer digital environment by adopting the mentioned requirements.
