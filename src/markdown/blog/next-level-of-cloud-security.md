### Dear friend, get ready to secure your apps & data in a multi-cloud world.

#### The era of remote work and cloud computing is here, and we're excited to share that you can experience enhanced cloud security right from your Cyscale account. This includes:

-   Multi-tenancy support for a Corporate Account and associated Users.
-   Single auto-onboarding step for multiple Azure Subscriptions under a Tenant.
-   [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/cyscale.cyscale?tab=overview) listing of the Cyscale Cloud Platform.
-   Signup & access the Cyscale account using Microsoft, Google, or GitHub social logins.
-   Notifications to _Slack_, _Teams_, _Datadog,_ and _Email_. Whenever your security policies are violated, you're instantly notified. You can also manually send an alert later.
-   Simplified onboarding for AWS and Google Cloud using CloudFormation and Terraform.
-   Use API Keys to speed up integrations with CI/CD and other developer tools.
