# Job description

You will build new features such as the graph visualization for new integrations such as Kubernetes and Github, change/fix existing features such as improving the policy editor, take part in product discussions, and even meetings with potential customers and investors (if it's something you would like to do, of course).

## Benefits

-   €50,000 to €100,000 annual salary
-   Equity - shares/stock options (ESOP) - simulation available during interview

## Bonus

-   Working with up2date tech such as Cloud-Native Apps and Cybersecurity
-   The opportunity to have a key role in the early development stage of what we believe will be a landmark product in cloud security
-   A startup involves a lot more than just writing code - you will get to learn a lot in a lot of areas such as marketing, sales, and communication (if you want)

## Responsibilities

-   Take ownership of components of the frontend application
-   Help us build an application architecture that will allow performance and scaling
-   Write quality ReactJS components
