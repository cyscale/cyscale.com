  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

      puts you in charge of Security in the Cloud. You have the responsibility
      to protect your biggest asset: your data. Having a single dashboard to
      visualise and protect your multi-cloud infrastructure is the best way to
      tackle the advanced persistent threats targeting the Cloud."

  - title: Compliance & Regulatory
    text: The moment you start using any cloud provider, you must ensure compliance
      with various regulations and certifications. Each industry is different
      and can fall under the incidence of sector-specific legislation such as
      HIPAA for health data in the US or NIST for organizations working with the
      US government or general standards like CIS or PCI-DSS for payments.
      Increasingly though, general data protection regulations such as the GDPR
      in Europe, CCPA in California, LGPD in Brazil etc. have made data
      protection mandatory by law, with hefty fines applied to those who do not
      comply with their requirements. We can help you with all of them by
      automating and generating Compliance Assessments for each of your cloud
      environments.
