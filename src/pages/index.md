          Most Cloud Providers operate under the Shared Responsibility Model, which puts you in charge of Security in the Cloud. You have the responsibility to protect your biggest asset: your data. Having a single dashboard to visualise and protect your multi-cloud infrastructure is the best way to tackle the advanced persistent threats targeting the Cloud.

      title: Compliance & Regulatory
      text: >
          The moment you start using any cloud provider, you must ensure compliance with various regulations and certifications. Each industry is different and can fall under the incidence of sector-specific legislation such as HIPAA for health data in the US or NIST for organizations working with the US government or general standards like CIS or PCI-DSS for payments. Increasingly though, general data protection regulations such as the GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, LGPD in Brazil etc. have made data protection mandatory by law, with hefty fines applied to those who do not comply with their requirements. We can help you with all of them by automating and generating Compliance Assessments for each of your cloud environments.
