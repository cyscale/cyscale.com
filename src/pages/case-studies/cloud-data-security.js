                                Data security in the cloud became a priority as this data intelligence company was
                                experiencing near 20% year-on-year growth, onboarding customers into a flexible
                                environment including on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud, including AWS, Azure and
                                Google Cloud. The company also relied heavily on Kubernetes clusters that needed
                                security and compliance coverage, as it was losing visibility of the relationship
                                between customer-generated data and the associated data security risk.
