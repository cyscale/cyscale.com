                                to ensure complete and ongoing state-of-the-art data center security. They have many years of 
                                experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers, which makes them

                                <strong>Cyscale Platformâ€™s</strong> cloud infrastructure is hosted in a fully redundant, secure environment, with strictly 
                                controlled access using role-based access management and restrictions applied following the principle of least
                                privilege. In addition, we leverage security features from the cloud provider such as firewall protection, 
                                making sure that only necessary ports are open to the outside network.

                                All data to and from <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> is sent securely over HTTPS. The
                                initial connection is established over 2048 bit TLS, and the rest of the communication
                                happens over 256 bit SSL. This is the standard technology for keeping an internet
                                connection secure and prevents anyone from reading and modifying any information. Any
                                data transferred between a user and <strong> Cyscale</strong> Platform is impossible to
                                read or modify. We use the same level of encryption as do banks and financial
                                institutions. All data is encrypted using SHA256withRSA algorithms, which scramble data
                                in transit, preventing hackers from reading it. Your company-specific data inside{' '}
                                <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> is kept separate through a logical separation at the
                                data tier, based on application-level access permissions and roles you set up in your
                                workspaces. Passwords and other credentials are encrypted so the database doesn't store actual values.
