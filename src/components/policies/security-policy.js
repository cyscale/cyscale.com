                                Microsoft Azure maintains an impressive list of reports, certifications, and independent assessments 
                                to ensure complete and ongoing state-of-the-art data center security. They have many years of 
                                experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers, which makes them 
                                the industry standard when it comes to security. The exact physical location of the data center 
                                that stores <strong>Cyscale Platform's</strong> data is private. Only required personnel within Microsoft are 
                                authorized to access Microsoft data centers. Additionally, data centers are secured with a variety

                                All <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> services run in an isolated cloud virtual network with rules that 
                                prevent unauthorized access and firewalls enabled to prevent unauthorized or malicious requests. Several 
                                procedures and controls are in place to ensure that access and changes to the 
                                production environments are made only with prior approval and the proper business justification. 
                                In addition, the services <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> uses to run on are fully redundant, and communications 
                                inside the virtual network are encrypted with the highest industry standards. Our Cloud Service Provider is 
                                accredited for implementing security practices against internationally recognized frameworks such as ISO 27001, 
                                SOC 2 Type 2, and PCI DSS. Alongside these reports, the production cloud environment that the <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong>
                                runs on is 100% aligned with the best practices suggested by the CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark.

                                All data to and from <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> is sent securely over HTTPS. The
                                initial connection is established over 2048 bit TLS, and the rest of the communication
                                happens over 256 bit SSL. This is the standard technology for keeping an internet
                                connection secure and prevents anyone from reading and modifying any information. Any
                                data transferred between a user and <strong> Cyscale</strong> Platform is impossible to
                                read or modify. We use the same level of encryption as do banks and financial
                                institutions. All data is encrypted using SHA256withRSA algorithms, which scramble data
                                in transit, preventing hackers from reading it. Your company-specific data inside{' '}
                                <strong>Cyscale Platform</strong> is kept separate through a logical separation at the
                                data tier, based on application-level access permissions and roles you set up in your
                                workspaces. Passwords and other credentials are encrypted so the database doesn't store actual values.
