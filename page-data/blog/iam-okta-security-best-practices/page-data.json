Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee uses a weak password for their accounts. The password was cracked through a brute-force attack by an attacker. \n\nThe employee re-uses their password for Okta SSO, and MFA is not implemented in the company, so the attacker now has full access to all of the employee's accounts. \n\n### Best practice \n\n[MFA](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is a type of authentication that requires an entity to provide at least two different types of credentials. \n\nThey should be of the following:  \n\n* What you know (example: a PIN)  \n* What you have (example: a security token)  \n* What you are (example: a fingerprint)  \n\nOkta recommends you use a one-time password or a biometric verification in your authentication scheme in order to add an extra layer of security. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 2. Stop using passwords \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee writes their password on a post-it note and leaves it on their desk. \n\nAn employee from another department finds it and can now login into the employee's account. \n\n### Best practice \n\nPasswordless authentication is possible by providing a public identifier (such as a username or an email address) and then using a different way of proving your identity (through a phone or a token, for example), thus eliminating the use of passwords. \n\nThis type of authentication is secure because: \n\n* Weak passwords are no longer a concern for your company \n* Solutions for password storage are not an issue anymore \n* The credentials cannot be breached; therefore, you're reducing the number of points of failure \n\nOkta suggests solutions that can help you go passwordless. You can use: \n\n* Okta Fastpass, which allows you to authenticate passwordless from any device or location to any Okta-managed application; \n* WebAuthn, a standard that simplifies authentication. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 3. Manage user access by following the Least Privilege Principle \n\n### Scenario \n\nAlthough they do not require such privileges, an employee was assigned administrative rights. \n\nThe employee accidentally deletes an asset—this action results in permanent data loss. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that users should not have more permissions than they require to perform their tasks. \n\nUser access control management is a security best practice recommended by [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) that helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nFor example, a regular user should not have administrator rights unless they need them for daily tasks. \n\nMake sure to restrict users as much as possible in accordance with their jobs. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 4. Ensure the Separation of Duties \n\n### Scenario \n\nThe administrator goes on vacation. They are the only ones with administrator privileges.  \n\nA critical vulnerability appears in the cloud infrastructure, but nobody has the necessary rights to patch it. The administrator cannot be contacted and is out of the office for a few weeks. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Separation of Duties Principle helps eliminate a single point of failure by assuring no entity has the rights to execute a critical task by themselves. \n\nConfiguring at least two administrators eliminates the single point of failure. It ensures that if one of them is missing, the other can still perform tasks requiring administrative privileges. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 5. Monitor activity \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn attacker manages to gain control of an employee's account and authenticates from a different device or an unusual location. \n\nThis authentication is logged, but the logs are not carefully monitored, so the breach goes undetected. \n\nThe hacker can now move laterally and compromise workstations, databases, and other accounts without raising any alarms in the company. \n\n### Best practice \n\nLogging and monitoring are two features that should be implemented in your cloud environment. \n\nThese technologies can help you identify suspicious behavior, such as: \n\n* **an impossible log-in**, for example when a user authenticates from two different parts of the world in a few minutes, \n* **a user connecting to an application from a different device than expected**, and others. \n\nOkta recommends that you constantly look for odd activity in your cloud infrastructure and make sure you take actions when you identify them, such as verifying a user's identity through MFA. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 6. Automate onboarding and offboarding \n\n### Scenario \n\nA software developer leaves the company, but their account is not correctly deprovisioned.  \n\nThey can still contribute to GitHub repositories and modify production code. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious. \n\nThere should be a well-defined set of steps when an employee leaves the company. Automate as many of them as possible, to make sure that: \n\n* You correctly deprovision their account, and \n* They cannot access and make changes to your systems anymore. \n\nAlong with these Okta-centric recommendations, it's essential to ensure that your organization adheres to broader **[cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)**. Diversifying your security strategies and keeping abreast of best practices in the wider cloud ecosystem provides a layered defense against potential threats.\n\n<br/>\n\nAre you following these best practices in your company? \n\nWith [Cyscale - Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), you can detect drifts from some of these best practices recommended by Okta. \n\nCyscale checks if access to your cloud environment is correctly configured and is implementing the following: \n\n* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Logging and monitoring, \n* Access control, \n* Strong credential policies and many more. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM and Other Features You Never Knew Existed ","seoTitle":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM","description":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","seoDescription":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","date":"2023-08-23T15:16:04.584Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/41be8/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/c78f7/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/913d0/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/91660/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/888e2/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"While assessing the controls suggested by the CIS Benchmark 2.0.0 for Google Cloud, I stumbled upon an interesting recommendation: to launch compute instances with Shielded VM enabled. When you think of VM security, you think of open management ports, outdated OS versions, unencrypted VM disks and so on. So what is Shielded VM and why do you need to enable it ASAP? \n\n\n\n## Shielded VM \n\nShielded VM, in a cloud computing context, is a security solution that hardens VMs deployed in Google Cloud. This measure protects them against rootkits and bootkits, which are essentially malware that infect and obtain persistence in VMs, allowing attackers to infiltrate in the cloud environment through the Compute Instances. It’s like a magical portal into your entire cloud infrastructure, which, if created, opens on command for the hackers.    \n\nThe advantage of this setting is that, with just a few clicks, you significantly increase the protection of your [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) VM by providing it with: \n\n* Secure Boot, \n* vTPM, \n* Integrity monitoring. \n\n**Secure Boot** is a feature that verifies the digital signature of all boot components of a virtual machine. In this way, if any signature verification fails, that boot process is halted, thus ensuring that only authentic software is run on the system. This means that you cannot use any custom drivers on the machine, because if you do, it will cause the VM to not boot anymore. If a failure occurs, the user receives two errors:\n\n* **UEFI: Failed to load image**, and \n* **Status: Security Violation.** \n\n**vTPM, or Virtual Trusted Platform Module,** is a computer chip specialized in protecting secrets. To understand what vTPM is, let’s break it down. TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a hardware component that stores cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive data securely. By virtualizing it, the same result is achieved, but on a software level, meaning that VMs in the cloud can also be protected using a TPM, even though at hardware-level they may share components with other VMs. \n\nvTPM also introduces **Measure Boot**, a mechanism that checks the integrity of the VM’s components. When the VM first boots, Measure Boot establishes an **integrity policy** baseline by calculating hashes of the components, concatenating them and rehashing them into a final hash to guarantee a sound integrity monitoring. Then, every time the VM boots up, the hash is recalculated and checked against the initial one, thus being able to tell if there are any changes in the boot process. \n\nThe integrity policy baseline needs to be updated if changes appear, such as a system update. \n\nThrough the process described, **integrity monitoring** is achieved using Shielded VM and the Measure Boot mechanism. \n\n\n\n### How to enable Shielded VM \n\nTo enable Shielded VM, you can do it through the Google Cloud console, or using the Cloud shell.  \n\n**Using the Google Cloud console** \n\n1. Log in to your Google Cloud console and navigate to Compute Instances (or click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)). \n2. For each VM on which you want to enable the feature, follow these steps: \n\n   1. Click on the VM name to go to its details page.\n   2. On the upper right area of the page, select EDIT. \n   3. Scroll down to “Security and access” and check boxes accordingly to your desired settings. Please note that you cannot select “Integrity Monitoring” without checking “Turn on vTPM”, as Integrity monitoring is a feature provided by vTPM. \n\n**Using the Cloud shell** \n\n1. Stop the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances stop <instanceName>`\n\n2. Turn on vTPM and Integrity Monitoring: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vtpm --shieldedvm-integrity-monitoring`\n\n3. To also turn on Secure Boot (if you have no custom or unsigned drivers on the instance), add the *\\--shielded-vm-secure-boot* parameter to the previous command or execute the following command separately: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vm-secure-boot` \n\n4. After applying the changes, restart the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances start <instanceName>`\n\nNote that Shielded VM is not enabled by default on a VM. However, you can set an organizational policy that will cause all the future VMs to have Shielded VM enabled. To do that, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm).  \n\n\n\n#### Other configurations that you should consider for your Google Cloud VMs \n\nThere are some settings you should always check when assessing the security of a virtual machine. Here are just a few examples: \n\n* Use **confidential computing** to [encrypt in-use data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this way, your data that is processed, trained on, used, queried on your VMs remains encrypted and is not at risk. \n* **Close management ports** if not needed: RDP (3389), SSH (21), WINRM (5985), these are all open gateways for hackers to intrude in your VMs and further down your cloud environment. \n* **Apply patches, OS updates** and any other available updates on your VMs to keep them up to date with the current versions of software and ensure that you’re not leaving them vulnerable to found exploits. \n* **Do not use public IP addresses** for your Compute instances, if possible. Public IP addresses introduce the same vulnerability in your environment as management ports: you increase your attack surface and expose the VM to the Internet. Instead, use load balancers to “hide” your VMs. \n\nAlthough there are many aspects you should consider when setting up your cloud [infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) securely, use this article as a checklist to tick off some of the most important security configurations."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud Security Challenges: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Solutions for 2023","seoTitle":"Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges: Threats and Solutions for 2023","description":"Understand the top 10 cloud security challenges, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, and learn how to build a roadmap to create a robust cloud security strategy for 2023 and beyond.

Protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance has become paramount for professionals like Solutions Architects, CISOs, Cloud Security Researchers, DevOps Engineers, and others in the technology space tasked with ensuring transformative technologies remain secure. \n\nBut what exactly are the top cloud security challenges, and why are they a matter of pressing concern? Whether its data breaches caused by cyberattacks or vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, cloud security threats are multifaceted and evolving, quickly outpacing our human ability to keep up. \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top 10 cloud security challenges and present a roadmap for creating a robust cloud security strategy, with real-life examples, actionable solutions, and insights to aid your journey towards a secure cloud. \n\n## Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges \n\nThe digital landscape is filled with opportunities, but it is not without its obstacles. Cloud security challenges represent significant hurdles that organizations must overcome to fully leverage the power of cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet's dive into the top 10 challenges that are shaping the conversation in 2023: \n\n### 1. Vulnerabilities in Cloud Infrastructure: \n\nThe rise of cloud computing has unveiled a plethora of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Whether it's poorly designed APIs or weak authentication protocols, these vulnerabilities are often the entry points for unauthorized access. \n\nThe famous [Equifax data breach in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) occurred due to a vulnerability in an Apache Struts framework that allowed attackers to leak data using a vulnerable API. That breach affected approximately 147 million customers. \n\n### 2. Security Threats from Hackers and Malware: \n\nHackers continually evolve their techniques to breach cloud security defenses or simply take services offline. From sophisticated malware to phishing attacks and holding services to ransom, the threats are relentless and require constant vigilance and real-time security solutions.  \n\nIn early 2023, one botnet conducted a complex DDoS attack that was able to issue between 50 and 70 million requests per second originating from different cloud providers, [according to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/). VMs in the cloud can be both targets of DDoS attacks, as well as unwitting participants if a compromise goes undetected. \n\n### 3. Misconfigurations and Human Errors: \n\nSimple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic data breaches and with many companies facing a complex and sprawling cloud infrastructure it’s easy to make mistakes. Human error, whether accidental or due to lack of understanding of cloud configurations, is a consistent challenge. \n\nLet’s look at a common cloud misconfiguration example: your S3 bucket, which contains sensitive data about your customers, is publicly accessible. It sounds obvious, but a simple setting - making the bucket private - can prevent someone from the Internet accessing the data. However, if you are not aware of that configuration, this simple oversight might become a significant problem for your company; this is why it is very important to continuously monitor for misconfigurations and ensure you fix any findings in a timely manner. \n\n### 4. Insider Threats and Unauthorized Access: \n\nFrom disgruntled employees to compromised credentials, insider threats pose a unique and often overlooked challenge. Rigorous access control and monitoring are essential.  \n\nMoreover, a robust offboarding process for users is important to ensure that former employees no longer have access to the company’s assets after they have left the organization. Although the process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious, there should be a well-defined set of steps to check access rights when an employee leaves the company. After all, a favorite exercise of compliance auditors is to check a list of recently departed employees against current permissions and entitlements.  \n\n### 5. Cloud Service Providers and Shared Responsibility Model: \n\nUnderstanding the shared responsibility model with cloud service providers (CSPs) like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is vital. The delineation of responsibilities can sometimes be blurred, leading to security gaps.  \n\nFor example, if a user thinks that the cloud provider secures a virtual machine, they might neglect:  \n\n* closing management ports such as RDP (3389) and SSH (22), \n* using network security tools (such as firewalls, access control lists, network security groups), \n* managing VM disk encryption. \n\nThis might leave the VM unprotected because of the expectation that security is ‘somebody else’s problem’. \n\n### 6. Data Breaches and Loss: \n\nProtecting sensitive data is at the heart of cloud security. Data breaches and loss due to cyberattacks, human error, or even natural disasters can have devastating effects on organizations. Having PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stolen or leaked can lead to very grave consequences for a company. \n\nIn January 2023, the American wireless network provider T-Mobile revealed that a data breach that [potentially affected 37 million accounts occurred](https://www.reuters.com/technology/t-mobile-says-investigating-data-breach-affecting-37-mln-accounts-2023-01-19/) during 2022. Names, billing addresses, emails and phone numbers were some of the data that was leaked through an API with no authorization. Immediately in the wake of the news, T-Mobile stock fell 1%, and the company is currently under investigation by the FCC which could lead to further penalties.  \n\n### 7. Non-Compliance and Legal Risks: \n\nAdhering to regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA in the cloud can be complex. Non-compliance carries both legal risks and potential damage to reputation, especially for organizations in regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare. Compliance with international standards and laws ensures that: \n\n* Your company follows current cybersecurity best practices, \n* The reputation of your company is well maintained due to the continuous efforts to remain compliant. \n\nTo understand how serious non-compliance penalties can be, HIPAA is a good example. The maximum financial penalty for a HIPAA financial is almost $2 million, while criminal penalties can put the wrong-doer in jail for up to 10 years. It’s worth noting that regulation is also trending in the direction of at fault executives being held personally accountable, including jail time, to ensure that infringements can’t be offset by profits.  \n\nOne of the worst HIPAA violation cases happened in 2008 in one of the UCLA Health System hospitals. Employees accessed celebrity patients' medical records without authorization. A settlement of $865,000 was paid by the hospital, and the employees faced disciplinary actions. In general, employee discipline only goes as far as termination of employment but in some cases, employees have done time behind bars. \n\n### 8. Security Controls and Configurations: \n\nA security control in the cloud is a measure implemented based on a recommendation, a best practice or a requirement, designed to ensure that security and compliance of cloud resources and configurations are achieved.  \n\nImplementing and managing the right security controls and configurations is critical and tools like a Cloud Security Posture Management ([CSPM) platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) can be instrumental in managing these aspects effectively. Some tools, like Cyscale, go even further and visibility is greatly improved by bringing all of the security controls into one place, compared to multiple lists and dashboards of controls for each cloud provider, which can make it particularly challenging to see the big picture in the case of multi-cloud infrastructures. \n\n### 9. Endpoint Security and Real-time Protections: \n\nEndpoints are any device connected to a network. Examples of devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, point of sale terminals, and others. \n\nWith the rise of IoT and mobile workforces, securing endpoints and implementing real-time protections is more important than ever and more challenging given that these endpoints are often in the possession of individuals or at not easily accessible locations. A compromised or stolen laptop belonging to a senior engineer might be a good example here.  \n\nReal-time protection allows for threat detection and rapid response to attacks as they happen, as well as data loss prevention. For example, if you detect that a suspicious identity has connected to one of your VMs in the cloud, you can quickly act and cut off that identity before it can pivot to other cloud resources in your infrastructure. \n\n### 10. Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud Environments: \n\nManaging security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduces complexity.  \n\nMulti-cloud setups demand the appropriate handling of various security controls specific to each cloud provider and maintaining visibility across them, while hybrid models require seamless integration and consistent policies between on-premises and public cloud assets. In both cases, the complexity of the infrastructure and policies increases, making it crucial to stay on top of your security posture. \n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the cloud environment, robust strategies, and leveraging solutions like [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nThe good news? These challenges aren't insurmountable. In the sections that follow, we'll explore best practices to fortify your cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Section 2: Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment. Whether you're a CISO, a Cloud Security Expert, or a Senior System Administrator, this roadmap is tailored to meet the unique requirements of your organization's cloud security posture. \n\n### 1. Assessment and Understanding of the Current State: \n\n* **Security Posture Analysis:** Understand the current security posture by evaluating the existing security controls, policies, and configurations. \n* **Risk Assessment:** Identify potential risks, vulnerabilities, and threats specific to your cloud environment, including unauthorized access, data loss, and insider threats. \n* **Compliance Alignment:** Ensure that your cloud infrastructure aligns with industry regulations and standards like PCI-DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA. \n\n### 2. Creating a Security Framework and Policies: \n\n* **Define Security Objectives:** Establish clear and measurable security goals that align with organizational priorities. \n* **Implement Security Frameworks:** Utilize recognized frameworks such as NIST or ISO/IEC 27001 for a structured approach. \n* **Develop and Enforce Policies:** Create comprehensive security policies, including identity and access management (IAM), endpoint security, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). \n\n### 3.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in cloud security and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).
