The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds. As businesses move towards these multiple platforms, creating a comprehensive [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) becomes crucial.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security","CNAPP"],"title":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Data Plane vs. Management Plane, Access Roles and More","seoTitle":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Access Roles and More","description":"Azure Key Vault securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services.

And while it’s your safest bet to keep your crypto keys, certificates, and other secrets safe, it can become your worst enemy if you don’t manage it correctly. \n\n## What is Azure Key Vault? \n\nBefore we begin looking at best practices and security features of Key Vault, let’s go over the basics. \n\nAzure Key Vault is a Microsoft Azure product that securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services. It also allows users to manage a key's lifecycle, from key generation to destruction. \n\n*Did you know that if you create a key in a Key Vault, you can never actually see it? This is to safeguard against a human leaking the key. This also applies to imported keys.* \n\nAzure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard and Premium. The only difference between them is that Premium allows HSM protection for keys. HSM (Hardware Security Module) provides hardware security on top of the software security supplied by Azure as a fully managed, single tenant, premium safeguard. This is the most stringent security measure that can be applied to crypto keys. \n\n## Access control management in Azure Key Vault \n\nKey Vault authorization is done on two different planes: \n\n* The management plane, which allows users to delete key vaults, update access policies, and see properties, and \n* The data plane, where Key Vault objects can be added, deleted and modified. \n\nBasically, if you have access to the management plane, you can modify the cloud resource but have no access to the actual data in it. The opposite goes for the data plane, where you can make operations on the secrets, keys, and certificates but cannot, for example, add or remove access policies. You can delete a key, but not the actual key vault. \n\nNow that we know the difference between the two planes, let's look at some of the most used built-in RBAC roles for Key Vaults. Remember that Role Base Access Controls (RBAC) are used to restrict access to the network based on the user’s role. \n\n*Authorization for the data plane can be done using Azure Key Vault access policies as well as RBAC roles, but for the management plane, only RBAC roles can be used. Access policies are now considered legacy, and we recommend using RBAC.* \n\nAnd while access control policies help you define fine-grained control over objects and resources, this is not the way to go anymore. Policies are not a centralized management solution, meaning that you can’t just see and change permissions in one place; you would have to check each policy to see what a user's effective permissions are. Moreover, removing permissions can be difficult; the user no longer needs access to keys? Instead of going over one or more policies and unchecking the boxes that give them access, you can just remove their Key Vault Crypto Officer role, and you’re done! That way you don’t risk forgetting about a policy in the process. \n\nTo transition from access policies to RBAC, assess current permissions for all users, change to an RBAC permission model, establish the correct roles for them (and follow the Least Privilege Principle), assign those roles, and thoroughly test the setup. And to know which Key Vault Roles to use, keep reading this article! \n\n## Roles in Azure Key Vault \n\nManaging access control correctly and using the appropriate role for the job is good practice for cloud security. Following the Least Privilege Principle and only providing the necessary permissions are the keys to minimizing attack surfaces and giving your cloud environment the best chance against attackers. \n\nLet’s look at some of the available built-in Key Vault roles provided by Microsoft Azure. Remember that these roles only work if you've set Azure RBAC as the permission model (which is recommended). \n\n1. **Key Vault Reader**: This role provides the user with permission to read metadata of key vaults and their objects (certificates, keys, secrets). \n2. **Key Vault Administrator**: As an Administrator, you have all data plane permissions on all types of objects. \n3. **Key Vault Secrets Officer, Key Vault Certificates Officer, Key Vault Crypto Officer**: These three roles allow users to perform all actions on the type of Key Vault object the role is for, except managing permissions. So, a Key Vault Certificates Officer would have permissions on certificates, and so on. \n4. **Key Vault Secrets User, Key Vault Crypto User**: These roles are similar to the previous one but have fewer permissions. The Secrets user can see the secret contents. The Crypto user can perform cryptographic operations using the keys stored in the Key Vault. *Notice how there’s no Key Vault Certificates User? The Secrets user can also read the secret portion of a certificate with a private key, so apps use this role to retrieve certificates.* \n\nKeep in mind that users who can manage permissions over the Key Vault can grant themselves data plane permissions by modifying the access policies, so this plane segregation only goes so far. For this reason, I will once again remind you – follow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)! Don't give users more permissions than the bare minimum they need to do their job.  \n\nExcess privileges can be a gateway to disaster.  \n\n## Safety and recovery features in Azure Key Vault \n\nAzure Key Vault has a very useful feature called **soft-delete**. This allows for Key Vaults and Key Vault objects to remain recoverable for a period of 7 to 90 days (if no period is specified, then the default is set to 90). So, if someone accidentally deletes something, it can still be recovered within that timeframe. \n\n*Soft-delete is set to Enabled by default for new Key Vaults, and if a Key Vault has soft-delete enabled, it can never be disabled.* By design, Azure Key Vault makes it hard for users to lose their keys! \n\nBesides soft-delete, there’s also **purge protection**. This is another safety feature that goes beyond soft-delete, by preventing accidental **permanent** deletion. If you want to protect your Azure Key Vault from deletion while it is in its soft-deleted state, it ensures that no-one can delete it before the soft-delete period is over. **Once purge protection is enabled, just like soft-delete, it cannot be disabled.**  \n\nTo purge a Key Vault or a Key Vault object, you must have special permissions that are not, by default, given to any role. *The argument –enable-purge-protection can also be set to true to prevent anyone from purging a resource.*  \n\nIf this sounds all complicated, we can sum it up easily: once you delete a soft-delete-enabled Key Vault resource, it goes into the soft-delete state for a set period. If you also have purge protection enabled, you can't force delete it before that period is up. It's a layered protection model; you must go through multiple steps to delete a resource, making it as fool-proof as possible.  \n\nIn terms of backup, Azure recommends that you only backup secrets that are business critical; due to the nature of Key Vaults, the objects stored in them are already ensured availability: “Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically failover requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user”.  \n\nYou also can't back up your vault. It can be an annoyance, but you must back up each object and then restore them one by one. To do this, you download a blob containing the secret in an encrypted form, which you can then upload back in your Azure Key Vault. You have to upload it back in the same subscription to be able to use it (and, of course, in Azure Key Vault, not somewhere else). \n\n## Logging and protection in Azure Key Vault \n\nBesides following the best practices described in this article, you can also enable **Microsoft Defender for Key Vault**. This enables: \n\n* threat detection,  \n* threat intelligence,  \n* anomaly detection, and  \n* behavior analytics. \n\nAlso, don't forget about logging! Ensure to log user activity to identify suspicious behavior and obtain an audit trail to identify who accessed Key Vaults and when. \n\nYou can find all of these best practices and more in the Cyscale app, where we highlight misconfigurations and give you step-by-step instructions on configuring Azure Key Vaults correctly and keeping your secrets safe. \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","120001781","2024892666","2199015418","220583031","273821743","3058837307","3355083976","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
