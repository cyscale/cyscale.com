Network administrators in legacy systems invest significant effort into securing routers, adding firewalls and ensuring that all network devices function correctly. In the cloud, under the shared responsibility model, the customer does not deal with physical devices anymore, and security is shifted to identity and access control, known as [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), which focuses on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets.  \n\n## Why is IAM important? \n\nIf a user with high privileges is compromised in the cloud, a situation can escalate to critical levels quickly leaving vulnerable apps and data exposed; this is why IAM is the first and most important line of defense against attackers.  \n\n## How do you manage IAM in the cloud? \n\nNowadays, every employee has multiple accounts for different tools they use, such as HR applications, a CRM or ERP solution, various cloud platforms, and more. We do not live in a world where one person equals one account to manage, meaning the process of securing access is complicated from the start.  \n\nA single developer or other IT employee might need to have access to multiple cloud environments, a version control system, a deployment platform, and a ticket management system, and if you multiply that by 10 or 100 employees the number of accounts or users you need to manage is quickly getting into the hundreds or thousands.  \n\nIt’s impossible to manually handle so many accounts and ensure that they’re all properly secured, granted appropriate permissions, and correctly deprovisioned when employees leave.  \n\n### Key IAM processes: The access management lifecycle   \n\nLet’s take a look at the key stages in the access management lifecycle, keeping in mind that these processes need to apply to the individual and all the user accounts they are associated with: \n\n* **Onboarding:** the first stage involves creating a new user, assigning roles to it and providing permissions over resources. \n* **Role management:** in this stage, roles are already defined and configured for users. New roles and permissions may be added based on needs. \n* **Access review:** these are periodic evaluations of permissions assigned to users, groups, or roles. This stage involves reviewing and validating that individuals or entities have appropriate access levels based on their current roles and responsibilities. \n* **Offboarding:** This stage is crucial and involves removing users from the company's systems, revoking permissions and disabling accounts, thus preventing unauthorized access after an individual leaves the organization. \n\n### Centralizing IAM processes in the cloud \n\nIn order to handle an impossible workload and ensure due process is followed each and every time, centralization has become key. Let’s look at best practices to secure [IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) throughout the identity lifecycle. \n\n### SSO (Single Sign-On) \n\nOften, companies will deploy multiple cloud accounts, and the best practice is to organize these using provider specific mechanisms (ie. Organizations and Folders in AWS, Management Groups in Azure, etc.). Managing identities at cloud account level would quickly become unmanageable and it’s best to keep those at a minimum. \n\nA cloud company should use an identity provider (whether that’s one built-in into the cloud service provider, such as Azure AD, or an external SSO provider, like [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/)) to manage cloud access, as opposed to having multiple users defined within individual cloud accounts. \n\nManaging identities in a central location, as well as using SSO, are key elements of ensuring IAM security in the cloud. These are the risks of not using SSO in your company: \n\n1. **Password fatigue leading to security issues.** Having users input their passwords multiple times a day and for different applications can and probably will lead to them re-using the same password across multiple platforms or using very simple, easy to remember passwords. No-one wants to pull out the password manager 20 times a day. Password fatigue can lead to credentials leak and may put a company in danger.  \n2. **Long-term credentials.** When you create an IAM user in AWS, you create a password or an access key. Those credentials are long term and can end up being leaked. However, when you use SSO, the mechanism creates temporary credentials that expire after the user's session. This helps mitigate the risk of long-term credential exposure, because even if these temporary credentials were to be leaked, they would only be valid for a short period. \n3. **It’s overall a better user experience.**  \n\n### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) \n\nThis is considered essential. To clarify the point: your employees should not have any accounts without MFA. Whether they’re using a passwordless solution, or still using passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone, but especially for high-privilege users.  \n\nWe can’t labor this point enough. There are so many breaches that could have been prevented with MFA! For example, [Deloitte suffered an incident in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails) where the company’s clients were affected just because an administrative account did not have MFA. Emails, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and even health data were at risk. \n\nIn 2014, Home Depot had an estimated 56 million payment cards exposed after a third-party vendor’s stolen login details were used to breach the company. Again, MFA could have prevented such a breach. \n\nIf you’re already using SSO in your company, you should enforce an MFA policy at the identity provider level and better manage this setting for all your users. \n\nWe even demonstrated how MFA can prevent an attack from spreading in an Azure cloud environment, you can read that article [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/compromising-azure-cloud-as-guest/). \n\nBeware however that threat actors are innovating in this space too. A newish social engineering type approach known as an MFA Fatigue attack sees hackers relentlessly pushing MFA access requests to users’ endpoint devices and combining this with stolen logins to try and wear down a user to the point where they accidently allow access.  \n\n### Get full visibility of users and accounts \n\nYou can’t secure what you can’t see (or you don’t know about). So, it’s impossible to have a good security posture in the cloud without full visibility of all your assets, your people and their respective user accounts, role assignments, groups, and so on. \n\nThis is why a centralized solution for access review is the best approach to managing this challenge: having all permissions, roles, and user accounts visible via one single dashboard is very attractive for security professionals trying to manage access in the cloud. \n\nIn the image below we notice how one single person has permissions over Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, GitHub, and other environments. Besides this, we see the effective permissions assigned to each cloud account or application, security information such as the password’s lifetime and whether MFA is activated; this information would normally be spread out across multiple consoles and hard to follow. \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-iam-security-dashboard.jpeg\" alt=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" title=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUsing this dashboard, you can review users’ access in a timely manner, without missing important information. You can go through users one by one and review the permissions they have, instead of circling through groups and permissions trying to figure out what users inherit based on their group assignment. \n\nAfter configuring your cloud environment and assigning roles and permissions, an IAM dashboard like the one in the image above can help you to identify any gaps left in your cloud user management and should be treated as best practice.  \n\n### Finding and resolving excessive permissions \n\nIdentifying users with excessive permissions can help prevent an attacker from escalating privileges in a cloud environment. You can use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) to assign high privileges for a limited amount of time to users and therefore limit the attack surface.  \n\nFollow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) when configuring users’ roles and permissions to ensure that they do not have access to resources they don’t need to use. \n\nIn the previous section, we looked at an IAM dashboard and identified how many user accounts a single person has. On the right-hand side of the dashboard, we can see a “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-azure-iam-dashboard.jpeg\" alt=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" title=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe user ‘Gabriel’ has a Contributor role over the second subscription in Azure, revealing a wide range of permissions. This user has full access to manage all resources, meaning he can modify and delete resources. Alarm bells should start ringing here because if this user were to be compromised, the entire Azure environment would be at risk.  \n\n### Best practices for identity and access control  \n\nEffective IAM is crucial in today's cloud security landscape. From getting full visibility over assets, people, user accounts and permissions from the start, to good hygiene at every stage of the identity lifecycle, the guidance above will help you establish a strong strategy.  \n\nUse this checklist below to tick off the key elements that can, together with a centralized identity and access management approach, help improve your cloud security: \n\n* Deploy an effective onboarding and role management process \n* Review permissions frequently \n* Enforce a strong password policy \n* Adopt SSO \n* Enforce MFA \n* Achieve full visibility of assets, people and users \n* Apply the Least Privilege Principle \n* Deploy an effective offboarding process \n* Centralize IAM"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"The SaaS CTO Cloud Security Handbook: A Comprehensive Checklist ","seoTitle":"The SaaS CTO Cloud Security Handbook: A Comprehensive Checklist ","description":"A comprehensive checklist for SaaS and startup CTOs and CISOs.

Romania, for example, has earned its title as the ‘Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe’ thanks to the strength of the tech community in Cluj-Napoca, the second largest city in the country.  \n\n## **Public cloud as an enabler and a challenge** \n\nThe public cloud is the key enabler for all these businesses. But while cloud services from AWS, Azure, Google, Alibaba and others are more widely adopted and more secure than ever before, the cloud is an increasingly complex technology to manage, with a multitude of proprietary settings and controls, growing ever more granular. As a result, the greatest challenge to cloud as an enabler exists not in the security of the cloud itself, but in the policies, controls, and workflows for security of the technology.  \n\n## **Cloud security breaches are caused by mistakes and misconfigurations**  \n\nIn nearly all cases of cloud data breach, it is the user, not the cloud provider, who fails to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. In fact, Gartner estimates 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault and there is a wealth of additional research to back this up. \n\nThe simple fact is that humans can no longer correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually because of the sheer volume of alerts and complexity of configurations. The problem of SaaS security is especially pervasive in companies with small security teams, where it’s also especially hard for a CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure to prioritize remediation.   \n\nNot even large, well-resourced companies are exempt, with Microsoft, Twitter, and T-Mobile among the headlines in 2023 for security incidents leading to significant breaches of cloud data.   \n\n## **What makes an effective cloud security strategy?** \n\nIf you’re a SaaS CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure responsible for apps and data at a cloud-native or cloud-first business you need to deploy an effective cloud security strategy from the get-go. We’ve put together this SaaS CTO security checklist to help you understand what you need to do to get cloud security measures right from the start.\n\n## **The SaaS CTO security checklist**\n\nIn this article we look at the *[five key pillars that make up a strong cloud security strategy,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/)* including how to understand your unique cloud environment based on your specific usage of AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or whichever provider you choose.  \n\nYou also need to consider that your cloud environment may not be static, with developers adding and removing assets, and sensitive data being created on a frequent basis. So, this means your cloud security approach can’t be static either, and you will need some kind of continuous monitoring and assessment program to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities along with a regular review of security policies.  \n\nIn this *[guide to cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)* we go into actionable detail that will help you create a roadmap for deployment of your cloud security strategy, covering data security when data is in motion, in use, and at rest, the types of attacks that threaten your data and what you can do to defend against them.  \n\n## **Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure** \n\nA foundational building block for any cloud-native cybersecurity strategy is a thorough understanding of your infrastructure and unique characteristics of your web applications including microservices architectures, virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing, among others. \n\nThis guide looks at how you can *[properly assess your cloud-native infrastructure,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security/)* draw conclusions and create an efficient plan for remediation.  \n\nIf you need a *[deeper dive into the cloud-native technology stack,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/)* our explainer looks at the differences between cloud-native, cloud-based, and cloud-enabled approaches.  \n\n## **Understanding CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** \n\nAs adoption of the cloud has grown, so too has the need for specialized tools to secure it. At some point you will have come across the term Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) as an essential part of a cloud security program designed to identify and expose the unintentional risks that can expose your data, or make your code or your infrastructure vulnerable to hackers. \n\n## **What is CSPM?** \n\nCSPM solutions use the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google, to gather rich data on your specific cloud configuration and workloads. These cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\nUnintentional cloud configuration mistakes typically occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility into the organization’s cloud security posture due to too many dashboards, management panels, or controls. This becomes your problem.  \n\nRegardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to a disastrous data breach or leakage. \n\nWe have an *[essential guide to understanding Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/)* for those that need familiarize themselves.   \n\n## **Best practices for CSPM** \n\nIn our *[CSPM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/)* document, we look at how CSPM solutions can be used to ensure visibility of assets; use context to identify and prioritize assets with the greatest risk; ensure compliance with relevant frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST and more); maintain ongoing monitoring of your environment to identify new threats; and finally, direct you to efficient remediation.    \n\n## **What to look for in a CSPM solution** \n\nOur separate guide on *[what to look for in a CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/)* equips you with key questions to ask and considerations to help you make the right choice for your business at your current state of cloud maturity.  \n\nWhile our *[buyer’s guide to cloud security solutions](https://cyscale.com/blog/buyers-guide-cloud-security-solutions/)* goes into even further detail regarding the difference between enterprise-grade solutions, security offerings from your cloud service provider, and the free tools on offer.  \n\n## **Understanding CNAPP** \n\nAnother acronym you may encounter - CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) - refers to a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps and combines multiple functionalities from separate toolsets, including CSPM, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), essentially covering all the bases of identity and access, code, and infrastructure.  \n\nWe have a primer on *[cloud-native applications security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/)* that looks at why and when you may need a CNAPP solution.  \n\n## **Common cloud misconfigurations and how to avoid them** \n\nIn terms of actionable insights, our extensive handbook on *[common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/)* looks at five of the most common cloud misconfigurations SaaS companies encounter, including: storage access configuration, access control, unrestricted network ports for inbound and outbound traffic, encryption oversights, or disabled or misconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\nWorking through this checklist can help you establish best practices for securing your apps and data in the cloud, including the use of tags to help establish security policies across all your relevant assets.  \n\n## **The dangers of alert fatigue** \n\nBy the time you have designed a cloud security strategy and possibly deployed a few tools to help you enforce it, you will begin generating security alerts.  \n\nFalse positive alerts are the bane of any CTO or CISO and with cloud environments becoming so complex, alert fatigue is a very real and growing problem. A constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming, because when everything is important, nothing is important.  \n\n*[Alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/)* is one of the biggest complaints cybersecurity professionals have about the tools they use. As a Cloud Security Manager we spoke to says: \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\"  \n\nSo when it comes to beating alert fatigue, the onus is on the tools you use, and we believe three innovations are essential: \n\nCustom risk rules – Define your own threshold for security posture. What works for one company won’t work for another. \n\nAutomation – With so many assets across so many cloud providers to track, humans cannot keep up. Continuous and automated detection of misconfigurations is critical. \n\nContext - Not all alerts are created equal, and different teams have different responsibilities. Context allows you to immediately prioritize tasks. \n\nWhich brings us to... \n\n## **Incident response planning** \n\nThis is a critical part of any effective cloud security plan, because while an effective security strategy focuses on preventative maintenance, an incident response plan sets out the steps you take when a security breach happens.  \n\n## **Designing an effective incident response plan** \n\nWe have a *[step-by-step checklist in our essential cloud security tips](https://cyscale.com/blog/essential-tips-cloud-security/)* you can use to establish your incident response plan, looking at: \n\n* Determining what caused the incident \n* Containing the incident \n* Notifying affected parties such as customers if customer data is affected\n* Conducting a root cause analysis \n* Implementing remediation measures \n* Learnings and evaluation \n\nAs the threat landscape constantly evolves, so must your cloud security awareness and strategy. Business leaders must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities as well as any changes in their existing environment.  \n\nEven with a good cloud security strategy in place, an effective plan is an adaptive plan, and one that ensures ongoing defense against new threats."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","description":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the first line of defense against attackers in the cloud.

In the realm of cloud security, IAM represents all of the measures and good practices implemented to prevent intruders from accessing cloud resources. \n\nAn organization's cloud environment may be in danger if authentication and authorization are not handled correctly. \n\nIAM, coupled with contextual security, is the recipe for success. Understanding the level of access for each user – as well as how that access impacts other assets – is vital. It may not seem like much if a user has read permissions over a storage account, but if that storage account contains sensitive data, such as credentials for another account, then the magnitude of the impact will surpass your initial assessment. \n\nIn this article, I will show you how human mistakes can lead to a complex attack path, where a malicious user gains access to a storage account, compromises a user, and ultimately gains access to a key vault that contains cryptographic keys and secrets used by the company’s apps. \n\nI’ve chosen a scenario where gross mistakes are made to highlight that you should not underestimate human error and the blast radius it can have.  \n\n## Case Study\n\nFintech Inc. is a financial technology startup developing a new banking application. A few customers already use the new app to access their banking data in real-time and manage their accounts. Fintech Inc. uses Microsoft Azure to develop and host their app. \n\nThe company must invite an external consultant, Anita, to collaborate in the cloud. Any user is allowed by default to invite guests in Microsoft Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory), so John, a member of the IT department, invites Anita as a guest. \n\nHowever, he makes a mistake; because he’s trying to accomplish many things in a short period of time, instead of inviting anita@fintechinc.com, he invites anita@fintech.com. The new guest user accepts the invitation and becomes a guest in Microsoft Entra ID. \n\nAs a guest, the \"fake\" Anita cannot do much. She can only access some resources that guests can access, she can manage her profile and collaborate with other users in Office 365 apps.  \n\nBut, looking closely, she discovers that she is now part of the ITAdmins group. How did that happen?! On a closer look, ITAdmins has a dynamic membership rule that states that all users whose department is \"IT\" become part of the group. The IT department wanted to make things easy for them and allow all employees in IT to join this group automatically. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-dynamic-membership-rule.png\" alt=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" title=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, this rule is very broad and opens up the possibility for mistakes. In this case, Anita was assigned the “IT” department, and she immediately joined the ITAdmins group, since Azure checks the attributes for a user whenever they are changed or a new user joins the cloud.  \n\nUpon further investigation, Anita discovers that the ITAdmins group has a very highly privileged role over the “rg-management\" resource group – the Contributor role. This role allows Anita to view, modify, and delete any resources within the resource group. Here comes the importance of the Least Privilege Principle – granting users too many permissions can do more harm than good. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-it-admins-contributor-rg-management.png\" alt=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" title=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we take a look at this resource group, we will see it contains an interesting storage account – “backups”, a database, and a VM. \n\nWe can see this relation in the graph below. Tracing the attack path, we immediately realize how Anita is able to access the cloud assets, from the rg-management resource group through the new role she gained by joining ITAdmins, and therefore compromise them. By looking at context in the cloud, we become aware of the risk imposed by the ITAdmins groups, which has broad permissions over a multitude of important resources. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-first-graph.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the attack path\" title=\"Graph showing the attack path\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe storage account has a \"backups\" container with a \"diskBackup.vhd\" file inside. This contains the files and data an ex-employee used before leaving the company. While in a rush, an IT admin has decided to back up the disk and look at it at some other time, later forgetting about it. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-backups-container.png\" alt=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" title=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUpon restoring this file as a computer disk, Anita discovers a set of credentials. She knows she should not log in using those credentials, but she does it anyway – after all, this is not the first questionable action she’s done -, because she is curious.  \n\nThe set of credentials – an email and a password – are for a test user that was created in the past to test features of the application, the removal of which was forgotten. The user cannot log in to the portal due to a Conditional Access policy that denies access to the Microsoft Azure Management resource (Portal included).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-access-to-portal-denied.png\" alt=\"Portal access denied for user\" title=\"Portal access denied for user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nFortunately, Anita can still log in using the credentials – through the CLI. This is a common \"bypass\" of this barrier, and, fortunately, she's good with command lines, so she can investigate what permissions her new user has. \n\nShe checks her new role assignments in the current subscription using the commandlet *Get-AzRoleAssignment* only to find, among other roles, that she’s a Key Vault Administrator. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-key-vault-administrator-role.png\" alt=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" title=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the Key Vault Administrator role, Anita can [perform all data plane operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) on the Credentials2 key vault that we can see in the image above, and all objects in it. \n\nA key vault is a huge discovery for Anita, who can investigate further. Using the commandlet *Get-AzKeyVaultSecret*, Anita can see that there are a few keys and secrets in the key vault. She can now read them, delete them or add new versions of those secrets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-contents-of-the-key-vault.png\" alt=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" title=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-second-graph.png\" alt=\"The attack path for the new user\" title=\"The attack path for the new user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nAnita can now further discover other assets available on Fintech Inc.’s Azure cloud environment and possibly make use of the secrets stored in the “Credentials2” Key Vault. For example, we know that, as a best practice, [databases are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/), so a leaked decryption cryptographic key, for example, can lead to total compromise of the company’s data. \n\nTo understand everything that happened here, we need to look at all the bad practices and vulnerabilities that we have uncovered, in chronological order: \n\n1. Due to being in a rush, an employee invited the wrong person to collaborate in Azure, and no one picked up on it. \n2. The dynamic membership rule for the ITAdmins group is very broad and may accept unintended cases. \n3. The ITAdmins group has a highly privileged role over a resource group with many resources that may contain sensitive information, such as databases, and storage accounts. \n4. A disk backup that can be restored is held unencrypted in a storage account, containing a cleartext password for an active Azure account. \n5. A test user that was intended to be temporary is still active. \n6. A test user has access to a very high-value resource. \n\nAs you can see, each mistake allowed the intruder to advance more and more and compromise additional resources. \n\nThis is why contextual security and proper IAM security are necessary. Contextual security allows cloud professionals to understand what assets are impacted by others, while IAM best practices protect the cloud environment from intruders and represent the first barrier of entry.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Product"],"title":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups    ","seoTitle":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups | Cyscale ","description":"This essential guide for startups looks at the pros and cons of enterprise-grade, free, and cloud providers' own security solutions.

From your intellectual property and software services you sell, to sensitive data on customers and users, any threat can put your reputation on the line.  \n\nWhile public cloud resources are key enablers of business, they come with the adoption of a shared responsibility model that makes it difficult to define your security perimeter. This makes securing your apps and data in the cloud a complex and confusing process. But it doesn’t have to be. Good cloud security is achievable for any business, regardless of size, and it shouldn’t take all your time and resources to get it right.  \n\n### Context is king \n\nHow many cloud resources or assets am I running? What even is a cloud resource? My engineers are creating new assets every week, how am I going to keep track of them all? Where does the responsibility of AWS end and mine begin? These are the kind of questions you are going to be faced with, whether cloud security is your full-time job or just part of your responsibility for the overall tech stack.  \n\nFinding answers to these questions and more, will take time and effort because there are no standard responses. Everyone’s cloud infrastructure is different and brings with it unique risks.  \n\nThis is why context is so important. Cybersecurity tools are notorious for creating alert fatigue – an overwhelming number of alerts for every vulnerability, misconfiguration, and new threat out there. Following up on all these alerts as and when they come in, can easily start out as a fool’s errand and frequently become humanly impossible.  \n\nFor example: An unsecured Virtual Machine in isolation may pose no risk but will still trigger an alert. An unsecured VM that has access to a bucket used to store sensitive client data poses a much bigger risk that your company, your customers, and your lawyers will care about.  \n\n**Identify** \n\nBeing able to identify the risks is only one part of the challenge.   \n\n**Prioritize** \n\nUnderstanding the context of the risk to prioritize it is an essential second stage in the process. \n\n**Fix** \n\nThe steps needed to remediate the risk are the third stage in the solution. \n\nBecause there is no one-size-fits-all solution to cloud infrastructure security, any attempt to follow this path will eventually result in frustration due to not feeling in control, and a lack of understanding of the impact of a security issue, which can lead to bigger threats.  \n\n### My cloud provider has its own security tools, can’t I just use them? \n\nAll the big cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer a suite of security tools specific to their products and these are a common choice for cloud native organizations as they can be added on when buying cloud services and are built by the same provider.  \n\nBut these solutions have evolved in line with the sprawling menu of cloud services on offer, and the application of these tools has become granular to the level where some security components and their corresponding configuration are attached to specific products and services, and then again to specific regions and resources.  \n\nThe cloud providers charge for security services in much the same way they do for cloud resources. Not only does this frequently trigger the ‘bill shock’ associated with cloud consumption, because activating a native security solution for a service introduces unpredictability into the pricing, it makes management of your cloud security posture very complex and time consuming.  \n\nThis approach has significant implications for context as well – because information is scattered within the toolset, you are required to make the relevant correlations yourself, resulting in poor overall visibility and blind spots.  \n\nFurthermore, this is just for a single cloud environment. If your organization needs to secure apps or data across multiple clouds, you need to learn a whole other set of security services and tools specific to the cloud environment.  \n\nSo, if you use the AWS supplied toolset, you must go to 1,000 different places to understand all your security settings, let alone how all the security settings relate and connect to one another. And when you go to Azure, it's another 1,000 places that you go to check. \n\nOf course, some companies will become proficient in using the cloud provider’s own security tools, but there is still the associated cost in deployment and the investment into a non-transferrable skill. This can result in cloud security know-how being concentrated within certain people and makes it difficult to understand your broader posture from both a cloud security and compliance perspective.  \n\n### What about the big-name cloud security solutions I read about in a Gartner report? \n\nThere are well-established vendors, like Check Point, that have developed their portfolios over time, and there are relative newcomers to cloud security, like Orca and Wiz, that have picked up big name customers and you would be wise to assess these offerings.  \n\nHowever, most of these solutions are targeted at enterprise customers with big teams and big budgets, and even the analysts note that some of the most comprehensive security solutions are not suitable for smaller organizations due to the investment required in skills, deployment, and management, not to mention the overall cost.  \n\nFor even the most experienced of users, heavyweight solutions can become overwhelming, resulting in a counter-effective approach as users lose control of their security posture.  \n\n### But there are free tools I can use \n\nThe cloud security landscape is very competitive and there are a range of tools available that claim to be completely free. But anyone making security tools for cloud infrastructure knows that cybersecurity is not something you can cut costs on, so these tools will not remain free, except perhaps for the smallest organizations.  \n\nMost of the free tools are limited in scope or capability requiring a paid ‘upgrade’ to unlock. Others are designed to be self-installed at the free level – a challenge in itself – while the as-a-service version comes with a price tag.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for, and solutions that have no investment in their development are unlikely to offer the level of service and support you get from a paid solution. These tools will quickly become frustrating due to a shortfall in features and an overreliance on multiple offerings to achieve an inferior result.  \n\nCyscale itself offers a free trial of the full product with no limitations, as well as onboarding support to ensure you will get the most value out of our solution before you buy.  \n\n### How do I address cloud infrastructure compliance? \n\nEnabled by the agility of cloud computing, many companies launch SaaS products into the market without fully understanding the regulatory climate, then realize they need to show compliance.   \n\nWith an infrastructure that changes on a weekly or even daily basis as engineers spin up new VMs and resources, preparing for an audit can be stressful, especially in regulated environments where you have to check your security posture against frameworks such as CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST, or many others. \n\nFurther challenges can arise in organizations where engineers have adopted a cloud provider’s own security tools, as these products are notoriously difficult to get visibility into whether established policies are being followed in implementations, leaving you blind to security drifts.   \n\nAt the end of the day, compliance should be delivered as a byproduct of good security, and your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) approach should ensure you are able to see compliance with regulatory frameworks and policies without the need to manually correlate reports from multiple applications.  \n\n### Identity, Access, and Entitlements \n\nOne of the biggest challenges when building applications in the cloud is identity, access, and entitlements, sometimes referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM). This refers to all the best practices and rules that must be followed when establishing authentication and authorization for a user to an organization’s systems and applications, because while keeping track of who has access to what sounds simple, it’s something that is really difficult to do in the cloud. \n\nMoreover, access is not restricted to human users; applications and other types of identities also require access to different types of resources.  \n\nOf course, the big cloud providers each have their own unique approach to access management, and this means learning approaches specific to each cloud environment. Some cloud security solutions integrate with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and help you manage identities and access form a central location, improving your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\n### Understanding the cloud infrastructure security landscape \n\n**Glossary** \n\n[CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management) \n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions are designed specifically for cloud environments, using the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers to gather rich data on cloud configuration and workloads. Cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\n[Misconfiguration](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) \n\nAn incorrect configuration of a cloud system that may lead to vulnerabilities. Possible misconfigurations are too many to list but may include making sensitive databases publicly accessible, creating identities with access rights more elevated than required, enabling write access on a resource that should be read only.  \n\n[Vulnerability](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) \n\nA vulnerability is an inherent weakness in a cloud system that means a resource is unable to resist the actions of a threat agent. A vulnerability could be created through a misconfiguration, or series of misconfigurations, but it could also be a newly discovered flaw in a piece of code or software that a resource is dependent on.  \n\nThreat \n\nA cloud threat is a type of attack or adversary looking to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in data breaches, data loss, system hijacking, and a myriad of other internal and external threats.  \n\nResource \n\nA cloud resource, also known as an asset, refers to any one of a number of entities including but not limited to, a virtual machine, a database, or storage bucket. An asset could also refer to VPC, subnet, policy, security key, or IP address. \n\n[CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) \n\nA CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps. A cloud-native application is an application that is designed for, run and hosted in the cloud.  \n\nCIEM \n\nCIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) tools manage identities and access privileges to cloud infrastructure and services. It is often deployed as an umbrella solution that includes Identity and Access Management (IAM). \n\n**Download this guide as a PDF** \n\n<div class=\"hs-cta-embed hs-cta-simple-placeholder hs-cta-embed-136438852760\" style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;width:210px;height:42.390625px\" data-hubspot-wrapper-cta-id=\"136438852760\"><a href=\"https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKTGbp%2Fo9uY%2B1cpwqxYO%2BVdgBMG2bgcgDZpv3UP7fDM0cPci8FmFfQrFEsURZY%2FBCwYOLNlG1XYE6BnbA1HIeTHNfwLiP2GUGYlTRO8CW82qb9egx0YmY9aQqHwOJa6iekClG%2FMfqEbCu0Dp5wkLzxfl7v4ITdglHTHc9cfvbVS11AWnEbx0NEGVzaWJngIJAT7AL7Hb9Sj8j%2BtDc7O96NDo4C5OsZhIeDO7CXDRRccKrDRsTFtfE9f4VAPVJWvV65oHjHpAVfzD5qX8u%2BU%2FIVvOMducO6AS96ZUM4%3D&webInteractiveContentId=136438852760&portalId=5413427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><img alt=\"Download\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5413427/interactive-136438852760.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: fill\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"/></a></div>"}}],"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3058837307","3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
