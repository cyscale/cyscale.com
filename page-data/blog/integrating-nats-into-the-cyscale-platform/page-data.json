To achieve this, the platform must be able to read (sync) the cloud resources, perform assessments against a set of controls (security and architecture guidelines and best practices), send notifications, generate reports, perform scheduled tasks, and so on. Given the highly distributed and segregated nature of the platform, we chose a microservices architecture on top of Kubernetes. Also, by design, these processes are mostly asynchronous, happening in the background as a result of a certain event or trigger.\n\nBesides direct HTTP communication (REST mostly for the account/user management and GraphQL for everything cloud-related), we make heavy use of message-based communication.\n\nUp until recently, Redis served as our backbone for sending messages. We used Redis Lists to simulate queues (e.g., for sending emails) and Redis Pub/Sub for, well, implementing the publish-subscribe pattern (e.g., for triggering the synchronization of the cloud resources). We knew since the beginning that Redis will not serve as the messaging middleware forever, but we started with it since it was already there for caching and tasks (through [Go Celery](https://github.com/gocelery/gocelery)).\n\nDue to a mix of accumulated technical debt and a desire for simplicity, we decided to invest in integrating a purpose-built technology for handling messages. After a good amount of research covering topics such as operational simplicity, community, and documentation, we decided to go with [NATS](https://nats.io/). As a side note, we continue to love Redis and there are plenty of well-established companies using it as their messaging middleware with great success.\n\nThe rest of the article will cover the main steps we took to integrate NATS into our platform such as understanding the NATS ecosystem, deploying the relevant tools on our Kubernetes cluster using Helm - this will form the main part since this is where we faced the most challenges, and, of course, sending and consuming messages.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n**The NATS Ecosystem**\n\n![The NATS ecosystem encompassing the core NATS server, JetStream, the NATS clients and CLI, and the NATS resources for Kubernetes](/img/cyscale-nats.webp 'The NATS ecosystem')\n\n### Core NATS\n\nAt its core, **the NATS server** is a **publish/subscribe** message broker. It offers **at most once delivery** and works based on **subjects**. These can have a hierarchical structure such as `sync.aws` and `sync.gcp`. Services concerned with messages related to syncing operations for AWS will only subscribe to `sync.aws` while other services might listen for all sync-related messages on `sync.*` (which covers both subjects) or even `sync.>` (which will also cover `sync.aws.ec2` - a separate subject).\n\nAnother feature that provides us with great value is called **queue groups**. This helps us horizontally scale our consumers while making sure that only one instance of a service receives a certain message. If you have experience with Kafka, it resembles consumer groups. What’s nice about queue groups is that they are automatically created when consumers subscribe to a subject and provide the queue group parameter (a simple string that, just like subjects, can have a hierarchical structure). For example, we use the name of the service (e.g. notifier) as the queue group.\n\nWhile the core functionality is great and simple, plain old pub/sub with at most once delivery will not cover all use cases. Subscribers might be under heavy load or even down, there might be a network partition or we might even want to keep messages and follow an approach based on event sourcing (you can find more examples in the [NATS docs](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream)). In other words, as soon as we need **temporal decoupling** between publishers and subscribers, we need **persistence**, which for NATS is provided by JetStream.\n\n### JetStream\n\nJetStream adds the concept of **streams** on top of the core NATS subjects. Basically, if you want your messages to be persisted, you can enable JetStream on the NATS server and create a stream that will actually store the messages sent to a subject (or multiple subjects - this is mostly to optimize resource utilization; for example, we have one stream called sync that stores all messages sent to any sync subject - i.e. sync.>).\n\nIf your system takes full advantage of JetStream, at most once delivery transforms into **at least once** and even **exactly once** by leveraging [message deduplication](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream/model_deep_dive#message-deduplication) (NATS will discard a message if another message with the same publisher-provided ID exists in the stream over a window of a certain time - 2 minutes by default).\n\nOne confusion we had at the beginning was whether we actually had to do anything to take advantage of JetStream besides enabling it. Again, bringing the simplicity up front, publishers will not require any modification unless you are looking for exactly-once delivery (you will have to add the message ID). They still send messages on a certain subject and, behind the scenes, JetStream will persist them in the configured stream.\n\nOn the other hand, **you do have to create the actual streams** (we will talk about this below) and **adjust the subscribers to use the JetStream API** (part of the client NATS library). Note that you can still use the core NATS API, but your subscribers will not receive messages sent before they started listening (even though they are stored in the stream). The reason behind this is that JetStream actually creates consumers that handle the delivery of messages for each subscriber. You will have to manually create the consumer when using the CLI, but the client libraries will handle this automatically when subscribing to a subject through the JetStream API.\n\nHaving the messages persisted also enables us to take different approaches based on what we want to achieve. We might still follow a pub/sub approach for certain subscribers (these are known as **push consumers**) (e.g. we use this approach for generating user-requested reports) or we might want to have more control over how messages are retrieved in which case we will use a **pull consumer**. This enables us to batch messages (e.g. we do this for sending notifications). Here is how we handle the messages in our notifier service:\n\n```typescript\nexport type MessageHandler = (data: NotificationDto[]) => Promise<void>;\n\nexport const handleNotificationMessages = async (handler: MessageHandler) => {\n    try {\n        const nc = await getNatsClient();\n\n        if (!process.env.NOTIFICATIONS_SUBJECT) {\n            throw Error('NOTIFICATIONS_SUBJECT not set');\n        }\n\n        const jc = JSONCodec<NotificationDto>();\n\n        const psub = await nc.jetstream().pullSubscribe(process.env.NOTIFICATIONS_SUBJECT, {\n            queue: 'notifier',\n            config: { durable_name: 'notifier' }\n        });\n\n        const done = (async () => {\n            let notifications: NotificationDto[] = [];\n            for await (const m of psub) {\n                try {\n                    notifications.push(jc.decode(m.data));\n                    m.ack(); // Wait to gather all messages from the current batch\n                    if (m.info.pending === 0) {\n                        await handler(notifications);\n                        logger.info(`Processing ${notifications.length} messages`);\n                        notifications = [];\n                    }\n                } catch (error) {\n                    logger.error(error);\n                }\n            }\n        })();\n\n        setInterval(() => {\n            psub.pull({ batch: 30, expires: 1000 });\n        }, 1000 * 30);\n\n        logger.info(`Listening for messages on ${process.env.NOTIFICATIONS_SUBJECT}`);\n\n        await done;\n        await psub.destroy();\n    } catch (e) {\n        logger.error(`Failed to initiate message listening ${e}`);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n(yes, most of our services are actually written in Go, hence the naming of some variables)\n\nAnother dilemma we faced was regarding **stream creation**. Who/what is responsible for creating the streams? One option is using the client libraries which expose a method to **idempotently** create streams. While this can work just fine, we didn’t want our services to bother with the technical details of NATS. Also, streams felt more like being part of the infrastructure than part of the actual services. So we continued our research and found [NACK](https://github.com/nats-io/nack) which we cover below.\n\nAs a side note regarding persistence/streaming with NATS, the precursor of JetStream is called STAN, which is now deprecated. We are mentioning this because there are still plenty of tutorials that focus on STAN, but JetStream is the way forward.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n## NATS on Kubernetes with Helm\n\nBeing part of the CNCF, we can expect NATS to have first-class support for Kubernetes. And it does.\n\nSince the entire Cyscale platform is specified as a Helm chart we just needed to add the [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/k8s/tree/main/helm/charts/nats) subchart as a dependency and configure the values. You can check the [values file](https://github.com/nats-io/k8s/blob/main/helm/charts/nats/values.yaml) from the chart repo for reference. One small detail that cost us a few hours was how we were specifying the values for NATS. If you look at [the documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/running/nats-kubernetes/helm-charts#jetstream), you will notice the `nats` object. However, since we are deploying NATS as a subchart, we will need an additional parent `nats` object to instruct Helm to pass the values down to the nats subchart. Here are our values for NATS on the dev cluster:\n\n```yaml\nnats:\n  nats:\n    image: nats:alpine\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        cpu: 100m\n        memory: 100Mi\n      limits:\n        cpu: 200m\n        memory: 200Mi\n    jetstream:\n      enabled: true\n      memStorage:\n        enabled: true\n        size: 80Mi\n      fileStorage:\n        enabled: true\n        size: 1Gi\n        storageDirectory: /data/\n        storageClassName: default\n```\n\n(notice the two `nats`)\n\nBesides the actual NATS server (which is a container running in the NATS pod along with the monitoring and config reloader containers), we also have a **NATS Box** pod (comes with the NATS Helm chart) that helps us with testing and administrative tasks - basically its a **preconfigured NATS CLI**. We access it using the command `kubectl exec -it <nats-box-container> -- /bin/sh -l`. The other alternative would have been to install the NATS CLI on our machines and port forward the NATS server from the cluster.\n\n### Creating the Streams with NACK\n\nBesides NATS, we also added the [NACK subchart](https://github.com/nats-io/k8s/tree/main/helm/charts/nack) which requires the NACK **CRDs** (install using `kubectl apply -f <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nats-io/nack/v0.6.0/deploy/crds.yml>`). That’s because it enables us to treat JetStream streams as Kubernetes resources deployed as part of the rest of the platform.\n\nInstead of having our services handle the stream creation or manually creating them from the NATS box, we specify them declaratively as follows (`templates/nats-streams.yaml`):\n\n```yaml\n# See https://github.com/nats-io/nack/blob/main/deploy/crds.yml for more properties\n{{- range .Values.nack.streams }}\napiVersion: jetstream.nats.io/v1beta2\nkind: Stream\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ .name | quote }}\nspec:\n  name: {{ .name }}\n  subjects: {{ .subjects }}\n  storage: {{ .storage | quote | default \"file\" }}\n  retention: {{ .retention | quote | default \"limits\" }}\n---\n{{- end }}\n```\n\nWe also declare the streams as a list in the values file (notice the `range`).\n\nOnce these are deployed, you can inspect the streams just like any other k8s resource using `kubectl get streams`. One issue we faced was that the streams were not actually created in JetStream (`nats stream ls` from the nats box) even though the k8s resources existed. We simply manually deleted them from the cluster (`kubectl delete streams.jetstream.nats.io --all`) and re-deployed the helm chart.\n\nThere is another alternative we considered - the [jetstream Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nats-io/jetstream/latest/docs). While we do use Terraform to declare our infrastructure on top of which the Kubernetes cluster is running, we chose NACK because it fit our abstraction layers best and because the terraform provider, running locally or in our pipelines, has to somehow reach the NATS server. In our case, the NATS server is not exposed outside of the cluster (again, port-forwarding is an option).\n\n### Ending Notes\n\nWhile there are more subjects to cover such as [authentication](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro) and [authorization](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/authorization), clustering (and [super-clusters](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/gateways)), and multi-tenancy using [accounts](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/accounts), we hope this article helps you better understand how NATS works and how to deploy it. This is our way of giving back to a growing community and expressing our appreciation for getting to work with such great technologies.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Cloud Security"],"title":"SMEs Face Security Pressure with Too Many Tools, Not Enough Skills","seoTitle":"SMEs face security pressure with too many tools, not enough skills","description":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","seoDescription":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","date":"2024-02-29T13:31:28.294Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"sme-security-pressure-too-many-tools-not-enough-skills","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/sme-security-pressure.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png","srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/ac644/sme-security-pressure.png 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/89b47/sme-security-pressure.png 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/913d0/sme-security-pressure.webp 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/91660/sme-security-pressure.webp 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/888e2/sme-security-pressure.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Security concerns are on the rise as the greatest challenge for IT admins at SMEs in Q1 2024, with 56% revealing that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture today than they were in April 2023.  \n\nAccording to [JumpCloud’s Q1 2024 SME IT Trends report](https://jumpcloud.com/resources/q1-2024-it-trends-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes), which surveyed IT stakeholders in UK, US, and India, the implication is that SMEs could be more vulnerable to cyber-attack than other segments. The report highlighted concerns over security amid a shortage of specialist skills and additional pressure on IT teams around compliance, with over two-thirds (75%) saying that more compliance and regulation requirements have been mandated in their region. \n\nThese concerns are backed up by long term trends in compliance. The International Organization for Standardization, which maintains the framework for ISO27001, said in its most recent report that certifications for ISO27001 increased 51% between 2020 to 2022 as more companies bowed to pressure from their own customers to prove security hardening and compliance.  \n\n## AI adoption is adding fuel to the fire \n\nWhile AI is seen by some as a cost-effective way of plugging the skills gap left by sweeping layoffs and a general lack of experienced professionals in specific sectors (such as security and cloud), IT admins tasked with integrating AI appear less confident, JumpCloud found.  \n\nDespite a mostly positive attitude toward AI in their organization, admins also report significant unease around AI’s impact on organizational security, with nearly two-thirds (62%) agreeing that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall. \n\n## Too many tools to be effective\n\nAnother challenge, compounded by a lack of manpower to carry out tasks, is that IT admins find themselves juggling too many tools to do their job.  \n\nThe vast majority (75%) of global respondents continue to prefer a single tool for a specific job rather than several-point solutions, roughly the same as the 77% who said the same in April 2023.  \n\n## MSPs come out on top \n\nBut this is all good news for Managed Service Providers, which continue to be a go-to resource for organizations under pressure.  \n\nNearly 76% rely on an MSP for at least some features and the trend is that organizations are leaning on MSPs for increased responsibilities, where SMEs are lacking the skills or the tools, or the ability to use the tools effectively.  \n\nThe survey found that an MSP completely manages the IT environment for 42% of respondents in UK, US, and India, versus 27% in April 2023—a 56% increase over 12 months. \n\nTellingly, security is the most common function for which organizations use MSPs (57% in 2024 versus 53% in April 2023), and the most popular reason why is that SMEs believe MSPs are up to date on the latest technologies (65%, up from 61% in April 2023), suggesting that smaller organizations are plugging the skills gap for complex subjects like security, cloud, and AI, with outsourcing.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Unlock New Revenue Streams With<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale Cloud Security for MSPs</span> \n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div> \n\n## Aggregation of tools and automation as the solution \n\nThese trends that JumpCloud has highlighted in the SME sector align closely with what we are hearing from the market and our own SME customer base.\n\nWhen it comes to cloud security specifically, IT admins and security professionals are struggling with multiple point solution tools that only apply to a single ecosystem. The cloud provider security tools only work for their own cloud, and skills for managing and securing that cloud are not transferable to another cloud either. This leaves SMEs struggling to meet security and compliance requirements and potentially losing business as a result.  \n\nSo, it comes as no surprise to see MSPs as the winners here. When small and medium businesses cannot get the skills in-house, but are seeing growing compliance pressures, they have no choice but to outsource the problem. What’s interesting is that MSPs and MSSPs face the same challenge, because the skills shortage is industry wide. But we work with a large number of managed service providers to help them unify their cloud security tools into a single platform and use automation to augment the security skills of their analysts to be transferable across all clouds and containerized environments.

In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

It’s not always by choice \n\nA multi-cloud strategy can combine the best of two (or more!) worlds, allowing cloud-native organizations to choose best-of-breed options for building apps and storing data in the cloud. At least this is true when the multi-cloud approach is by design.  \n\nIt’s not unheard of for a multi-cloud approach to happen by accident. Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","120001781","2024892666","2199015418","220583031","273821743","3058837307","3355083976","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
