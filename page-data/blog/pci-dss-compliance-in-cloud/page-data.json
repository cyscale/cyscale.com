In the following section, we will explain and map them to Cyscale controls to show you how to achieve a robust [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). Here are the 12 conditions: \n\n#### 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. \n\nTraffic to and from sensitive environments should be heavily filtered and restricted. Some examples of controls in Cyscale that ensure proper implementation are:  \n\n* *Ensure 'Enable connecting to serial ports' is not enabled for VM Instance* for GCP \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. \n\nThe first set of credentials attackers try when attempting to gain access to an account is the default one. You should always change the default passwords immediately after installing a feature.  \n\nAnother aspect to look out for is allowing default access configuration on cloud assets. \n\nExamples of controls that check if you’ve done this for the applications in your infrastructure are: \n\n* *Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users that have a console password* for AWS \n* *Ensure that Cloud Storage buckets are not anonymously or publicly accessible* for GCP \n\n#### 3. Protect stored cardholder data. \n\nThis requirement covers encryption, hashing, masking of customer’s debit or credit card data, as well as other techniques. It is an essential step because, when implemented correctly, even if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, they will not be able to read it.  \n\nSome examples of controls that ensure you’re not storing unprotected data are: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure that ‘Data encryption’ is set to ‘On’ on a SQL Database* for Azure \n\n#### 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. \n\nAll cardholder data transmitted over the Internet should be encrypted, to prevent malicious entities from reading it while it is in transit. You can find below examples of controls that ensure this implementation: \n\n* *Ensure that 'Secure transfer required' is set to 'Enabled'* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure S3 Bucket Policy allows HTTPS requests* for AWS \n\n#### 5. Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. \n\nMake sure security [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are enforced in the workplace, and anti-virus software, applications, and operating systems are up to date. \n\n#### 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. \n\nThe following devices and systems should be continuously secured and patched when dealing with cardholder data and transactions: \n\n* operating systems on virtual machines, \n* databases, \n* networking devices, \n* applications. \n\nExamples of controls in Cyscale that ensure this recommendation is attained are: \n\n* *Ensure Kubernetes web UI / Dashboard is disabled* for GCP \n* *Ensure that App Engine applications enforce HTTPS connections* for GCP \n\n#### 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know. \n\nMake sure only authorized personnel has access to customer’s card information and implement the Least Privilege Principle with the following controls: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs* for GCP \n\n#### 8. Identify and authenticate access to system components. \n\nImplement a robust authentication system that does not allow weak password usage and ensures regular rotation of keys and credentials.  \n\nJust two of the many controls Cyscale uses to ensure this requirement is implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days* for GCP \n* *Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one symbol* for AWS \n\n#### 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data. \n\nAccess to databases, computers, servers and other devices should be heavily restricted. Cloud providers are in charge of physical access to these systems. \n\nMake sure your cloud provider is PCI-DSS compliant and follows this requirement. AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP are all PCI-DSS compliant and ensure that the physical medium is protected.   \n\n#### 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. \n\nImplement logging and monitoring and track the logs in order to identify any suspicious behavior. Some examples of controls that ensure you have logging implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Auditing' is set to 'On'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 11. Regularly test security systems and processes. \n\nUse applications and scanners to find vulnerabilities, malware, and other abnormalities in your systems. In addition, PCI-DSS guidelines recommend performing penetration testing on the infrastructure and applications. \n\n#### 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel. \n\nEnsure that your staff is aware of security best practices and is regularly trained.  \n\nImplement strong policies to keep malicious entities away from your company and your customer’s data. \n\nSome controls that help you implement this requirement are: \n\n* *Ensure no \"root\" user account access key exists* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Notify about alerts with the following severity' is set to 'High'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n \n\nThese requirements can be implemented in no time using Cyscale controls and the steps described in them. \n\nBelow, you can see a small part of the PCI-DSS standard page from the Cyscale platform, along with the first two requirements from the list we’ve discussed. \n\n![The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale](/img/1.png#shadow \"The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale\")\n\nWe see a description and the controls necessary to ensure compliance by expanding the first requirement. The controls also contain steps on how to implement them. \n\n![The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale](/img/2.png#shadow \"The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale\")\n\n## Compliance levels \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/a-guide-to-the-4-pci-dss-compliance-levels), PCI-DSS has 4 levels of compliance, corresponding to the number of transactions processed by a company.  \n\nThe following [compliance](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) levels apply: \n\n* **Level 1:** over 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 2:** between 1 – 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 3:** between 20.000 – 1 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 4:** less than 20.000 transactions annually. \n\nBased on these levels, reporting and auditing differ.  \n\nAn audit is required once a year for all levels of PCI-DSS compliance, with different requirements: \n\n* a level 1 audit is performed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Internal Security Assessor (ISA), \n* an audit for levels 2, 3, and 4 can be completed with a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (QSA), \n* for level 1 and level 2 compliance, a Report of Compliance (RoC) must also be submitted to the acquiring bank. \n\n## Make this process easier for yourself \n\nConsidering the requirements presented in this article, it is not an easy task to become PCI-DSS compliant and obtain the certification. \n\nUse Cyscale in order to make sure you: \n\n* are correctly implementing technical requirements, \n* can demonstrate that your company is compliant. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find over 100 controls that will ensure PCI-DSS compliance and over 400 controls that will help you secure your cloud infrastructure and achieve compliance with other international standards, like GDPR, [ISO 27001, SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/), and many others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!
