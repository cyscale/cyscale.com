Still, companies outside this range also choose to become NIST compliant due to the excellent reputation and benefits of the standard. \n\nThree NIST frameworks can be used when establishing NIST compliance: \n\n* NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* NIST 800-53, \n* NIST 800-171. \n\nLet’s look at them in detail to understand the differences. \n\n## NIST Cybersecurity Framework \n\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) gathers best practices and standards to help companies build a robust cybersecurity program and manage risk.  \n\nThe framework contains 5 core functions, which contain 23 categories, which in turn are divided into 108 subcategories formulated as outcomes. Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing which framework is suitable for you and becoming compliant is not an easy task.  \n\nCyscale can help you ease the process of becoming NIST compliant. Using our Standards page, you can track your progress and speed up the process in terms of your cloud-specific needs. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-standards.png\" alt=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" title=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Compliance"],"title":"Compliance Countdown: Navigating the Transition to PCI DSS Version 4","seoTitle":"Compliance Countdown: Navigating the Transition to PCI DSS Version 4","description":"The new PCI DSS version has been released, and the old PCI DSS standard will be deprecated as of the 31st of March, 2024.

In this article, we will discuss all the deadlines by which you have to become compliant, details about the new requirements, and everything else you need to know about PCI DSS version 4.\n\n## Timeline and deadlines\n\nPCI DSS version 4 appeared at the end of March 2022 and its requirements will become mandatory in two phases: the first one is March of 2024, and the final one is March of 2025.\n\nThe new version brings considerable changes, but most of the new requirements will not be mandatory until 2025. However, companies that manage to fulfill them before 2025 can audit them.\n\nThe old version, PCI DSS 3.2.0., will remain active until the 31st of March, 2024, to allow companies enough time to recertify with the new version.\n\n## Changes in PCI DSS version 4, explained\n\nNew requirements have been added to all of the categories to better reflect the current cybersecurity landscape. Some examples of areas covered by the new requirements include the authentication process, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and others.\n\nMost of the sections have been revised or contain new requirements.\n\nPCI DSS is structured into twelve requirements, and each contains its own sections. The requirements are:\n\n### 1. Install and maintain network security controls\n\nThis requirement now specifies “network security controls” instead of “firewalls”, to cover more network security technologies. All of the sections in this category have been changed to the following:\n\n* 1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.\n* 1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.\n* 1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.\n* 1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.\n* 1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.\n\n### 2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components\n\nThis requirement was initially named “Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.”. Now, it refers to all of the company’s configurations, and not only to using vendor-supplied defaults. The sections in this category are the following:\n\n* 2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.\n* 2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.\n* 2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.\n\n### 3. Protect Stored Account Data\n\nWith the third requirement, the focus is switched to account data, compared to the old version, where “cardholder data\" was mentioned instead. New sections are added in relation to PAN (Primary Account Number) and SAD (Sensitive Authentication Data) which cover the storage, encryption and hashing of this data.\n\n* 3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.\n* 3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.\n* 3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.\n* 3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.\n* 3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.\n* 3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.\n* 3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key lifecycle are defined and implemented.\n\n### 4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks\n\n“Strong cryptography” is now part of the 4th requirement name, to highlight the importance of using appropriate algorithms. The new sections introduce rules regarding the storage and usage of keys and certificates. \n\n* 4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.  \n* 4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission. \n\n### 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software \n\nThis requirement has been renamed, replacing “anti-virus” with “malicious” software to cover a broader range of technologies. Moreover, sections in this category now regulate the frequency of scans and checks, as well as other aspects.\n\n* 5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.\n* 5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.\n* 5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.\n* 5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.\n\n### 6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software\n\nIn this requirement, one of the new sections added (6.4) refers to automating the detection and prevention of attacks over public-facing web apps. Sections 6.1 and 6.3 also contain new requirements.\n\n* 6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.\n* 6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.\n* 6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.\n* 6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.\n* 6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.\n\n### 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know\n\nThis requirement includes new rules regarding the review of user accounts and their privileges, as well as the management and privileges of applications and system accounts.\n\n* 7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.\n* 7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.\n* 7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).\n\n### 8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components \n\nMany new sections regarding MFA, credentials and the entire authentication process have been added in this requirement. Two examples of changes that companies compliant with PCI DSS have to implement now are: the minimum length of a user account password has increased from 7 to 12 characters, and companies are not allowed to store passwords/passphrases in scripts or files.\n\n* 8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.\n* 8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.\n* 8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.\n* 8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.\n* 8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.\n* 8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.\n\n### 9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data \n\nThis requirement does not have many changes. Some sections that refer to roles and responsibilities, as well as the frequency of device inspections have been added.\n\n* 9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.\n* 9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.\n* 9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.\n* 9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.\n* 9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.\n\n### 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data \n\nNew sections in this requirement regulate the automation of logging, prompt response to failed security controls, as well as how often logs should be reviewed:\n\n* 10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.\n* 10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.\n* 10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.\n* 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.\n* 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.\n* 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.\n* 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.\n\n### 11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly\n\nThis category includes the following:\n\n* a new requirement to manage all applicable vulnerabilities,\n* a new requirement to perform internal vulnerability scans via authenticated scanning,\n* a new requirement to deploy a change-and-tamper-detection mechanism to alert for unauthorized modifications to the HTTP headers and contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser, [according to PCI SSC](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r1.pdf).\n\nThe full list of the sections included in this requirement is:\n\n* 11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.\n* 11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.\n* 11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.\n* 11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.\n* 11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.\n* 11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.\n\n### 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs\n\nThe title modification reflects that the focus is on organizational policies and programs. In PCI DSS version 4, requirements specify that the audited company should, at least every 12 months:\n\n* document and review cryptographic cipher suites and protocols,\n* review hardware and software components,\n* document the PCI DSS scope,\n* review and update the security awareness program, among other requirements, which are presented below.\n\n \n\n* 12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.\n* 12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.\n* 12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.\n* 12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.\n* 12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.\n* 12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.\n* 12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.\n* 12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.\n* 12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.\n* 12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.\n\n## What do you have to do now? \n\nYou have to become PCI-DSS version 4 certified until the 31st of March 2024. There are two possible paths for your company:\n\n1. Your company is already PCI-DSS certified, so until the first deadline you must cover some of the new requirements and until the last deadline all of them, or\n2. Your company is not PCI-DSS certified, so you have to start from the beginning with the new PCI-DSS version and fulfill all requirements according to the specified deadlines.\n\nThis new version of PCI DSS brings considerable changes, and the process of achieving compliance with PCI DSS can be long and cumbersome.\n\nCyscale helps companies accelerate their cloud compliance process and ace audits by providing:\n\n* security controls that check if you’re implementing the requirements correctly, and\n* a page for each standard where you can track your progress and history."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Ranked Among Top Ten in AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator","seoTitle":"Cyscale Ranked Among Top Ten in AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator","description":"AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator is a program launched by Amazon Web Services in collaboration with Vestbee that is meant to help support startups in their journey of developing innovations in different industries such as Cybersecurity, AI & Big Data, Financial Services & Insurance, Sustainability and ClimateTech, and others.

It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers: \n\n* Real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, \n* A comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, \n* An overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, \n* Remediation solutions for findings, and many others. \n\nA CSPM is a solution that modern security teams use to proactively identify and fix security issues in their cloud infrastructure to ensure a strong security posture in the cloud. \n\n## A day in the life with CSPM \n\nWhat does a day in the life of a cloud security professional using a CSPM look like? First of all, we must see what it was like *before adopting a CSPM tool*. \n\nFrom manual security checks that take hours, to identifying and fixing compliance gaps, professionals may experience pressure in trying to secure the entire cloud environment. \n\nWith a CSPM, a cloud security team member can be more efficient. They may follow this workflow: \n\n1. The day starts by looking at open alerts and prioritizing the most important and impactful fixes. Using the remediation guidelines provided by the CSPM solution, they would solve some of the issues; \n2. The next step would be researching and understanding how to solve more complex problems identified by the CSPM: by looking at diagrams and dashboards, the user would gain enhanced visibility on how cloud resources are configured and relate to one another; \n3. If the company is going through an audit for a standard, such as ISO 27001 or PCI-DSS, they would assist their compliance colleagues with proper reporting and fixing any existing gaps; a low compliance score highlighted by the CSPM would indicate on which specific area they and the compliance team should focus on to improve the score. \n\nNow, using a comprehensive CSPM solution, confidence and control are gained. Notice how the cloud security professional is no longer spending time on security checks, but rather on actions that have an impact over the company’s cloud security posture. \n\nA CSPM tool has the following capabilities: \n\n### 1. Misconfigurations checks automation \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nOne common way in which scans are performed is controls. Security controls are based on recommendations and best practices; through them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nSome examples of common misconfigurations a CSPM looks for are: \n\n* An S3 bucket that should not be publicly accessible is, and anyone has READ or WRITE permissions on it, \n* The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port for a VM is open and can be accessed from the Internet, \n* Logging is disabled for cloud resources, thus unauthorized access cannot be detected. \n\nControls are among the most significant features you can find in a CSPM solution. Controls are based on security recommendations and best practices; using them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: from databases to buckets, from security groups to web applications, they cover a wide range of configurations and the result of using them surpasses any manual work that could be done. \n\n### 2. A robust alert system  \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nA good alert system can make a difference by reducing or eliminating false positives, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, and enabling understanding by adding context to findings. In this way, detected security issues are solved quickly, and *[alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/)* is avoided.  \n\nMoreover, a CSPM solution has integration with notification channels and ticketing systems to notify its users of findings. This feature is very useful for security teams because it streamlines the process and allows them to view urgent problems directly in the apps they use, such as Slack or Jira. \n\n### 3. Contextual visibility \n\nWithout proper visibility, a cloud security professional that intends to apply security best practices might do so in places with low impact, while higher risk items remain unaddressed. \n\nFor example, a company may have a VM running an application with a Log4Shell vulnerability, and multiple Internet-facing cloud resources that have less critical vulnerabilities. The VM may be prioritized because this type of vulnerability is severe and well-known. However, if that VM runs on a private network and is not accessible from the Internet, then the prioritization is not ideal, and Internet-facing applications and devices are neglected. \n\n### 4. Remediation steps \n\nA good CSPM solution aids security teams in their process of securing a cloud environment. \n\nDetailed remediation steps do not miss from CSPM software. Recommendations on how to fix findings include: \n\n* A series of actions a cloud security professional must execute in order to solve the identified problem, \n* A set of commands that fix the found issue, that can be used in a command line, \n* Recommended reading materials that could help the cloud security professional understand the problem on a deeper level and avoid it in the future. \n\n### 5. Compliance aid \n\nA company that seeks to achieve compliance with a certain standard or regulation must face a long and tedious journey, because this usually entails reviewing organizational, as well as technology-related practices, producing a lot of documentation in the form of policies and procedures, and ultimately ensuring that any system that comes in contact with customer data has appropriate security controls in place.  \n\nA CSPM tool eases this process by measuring the cloud security posture against the required state and providing compliance scoring. Moreover, after passing an audit, CSPMs can help companies stay compliant and ensure they’re following all security recommendations. \n\n### 6. Multi-cloud coverage \n\nWith CSPMs, you don’t need to monitor your infrastructure in a different place for each cloud service provider you’re using; CSPM tools are *[multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/)*! By covering Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, your entire technology stack in the cloud is secured by CSPMs. You can monitor and secure all of your cloud environments in one single platform. Moreover, you can define security policies in your CSPM tool and apply them across all cloud infrastructures. \n\nIn addition to analyzing security for cloud providers, some CSPMs offer additional types of integrations, such as those with identity providers. \n\nBy taking a proactive stance on cloud security posture, IT professionals can benefit from the power of a CSPM solution and ensure that their organization’s cloud infrastructure is resilient against emerging threats. \n\n### CSPM in Action - Real Life Case Studies \n\nCyscale is a [CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using powerful dashboards and security controls, saving teams considerable time on remediation.

ECS enables users to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.  \n\nIn this article, we will explore:  \n\n* what ECS is,  \n* how it works,  \n* common vulnerabilities, and most importantly,  \n* container security best practices to maximize cybersecurity on the ECS platform. \n\n## Understanding Amazon ECS \n\nAmazon ECS is a container orchestration service that simplifies the deployment and management of containers on AWS. It allows you to run containers at scale without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nECS provides the flexibility to choose between two launch types: EC2 and Fargate. With the EC2 launch type, containers are run on EC2 instances that you have to manage, while with Fargate, AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you only focus on deploying and scaling containers. \n\n## What is Amazon ECS used for? \n\nECS is a service suitable for a wide range of use cases, such as \n\n* **microservices architecture**: ECS enables you to break down your application into smaller, independently deployable microservices, facilitating scalability and flexibility. \n* **batch processing**: ECS simplifies the execution of batch workloads by running containers in parallel, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing processing time. \n* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: With ECS, you can build an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying containerized applications, ensuring faster and efficient software delivery. \n* **web applications**: ECS is ideal for hosting web apps, providing automatic scaling capabilities, load balancing, and seamless integration with other AWS services. \n\n## Common Vulnerabilities \n\nWhile ECS provides a robust container management framework, it's crucial to be aware of common vulnerabilities that can impact containerized apps: \n\n* **Inadequate IAM permissions**: Misconfigured AWS IAM roles and policies can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within ECS. \n* **Vulnerable container images**: Using outdated or insecure container images that contain known security vulnerabilities can expose applications to exploitation and malware. \n* **Weak network security**: Misconfigured security groups, improper network isolation, or exposure of unnecessary ports are a few examples that can lead to unauthorized access to containers or sensitive data. \n* **Lack of logging and monitoring**: Insufficient monitoring and logging of ECS services can make detecting and responding to security incidents challenging. \n\n## Best practices for containers security on ECS \n\nSecure your production environments and improve your cloud security posture by following the best practices described in this article. \n\n### 1. Implement IAM best practices\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege by assigning granular IAM roles to ECS tasks and services. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and follow AWS security best practices. Enforce strong password rules to ensure secure authentication. \n\n### 2. Secure container images \n\nUtilize secure container base images from trusted sources. Perform regular image scanning for new vulnerabilities and update container images. Leverage Dockerfile best practices to create secure and efficient Docker container images. \n\n### 3. Configure network security \n\nLeverage security groups and network ACLs to enforce fine-grained network traffic access controls for ECS containers. Only expose necessary ports and protocols, and use encryption for data in transit. Implement network segmentation by allowing connectivity only between the containers that truly need it and isolating the rest. Utilize Kubernetes network security policies to control the traffic between containers. Avoid using public IP addresses for ECS instances to prevent unintended access to your app servers. \n\n### 4. Enable logging and monitoring\n\nEnable detailed logging for ECS services and applications. Utilize AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize logs for monitoring and analysis and turn on Container Insights for your ECS clusters. Continuous monitoring can help you identify security issues at container runtime. \n\n### 5. Manage dependencies and vulnerabilities \n\nRegularly update and patch the host operating system and other software dependencies used within your container images. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in your containerized applications. If you’re using Fargate, ensure the services are running on the latest Fargate platform version; new updates come with security patches and bug fixes.  \n\n### 6. Do not run containers as the root user \n\nRunning containers with high privileges can increase the attack surface by allowing attackers to take advantage of this misconfiguration and “escape” the containers, obtaining high privileges on the host virtual machine. This breaks the isolation of containers. Run your ECS containers as non-privileged by setting the *privileged* parameter in the container definition to *false*. \n\nMitigate security risks by implementing the recommended best practices and secure your container environment. \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale provides a Containers dashboard, where you can see what assets are using them and other details about containers, as well as controls that check for ECS misconfigurations and provide alerting and remediation steps to fix findings in no time.  \n\nSome examples of security controls that you can find on the Cyscale platform are: \n\n* *Ensure ECS services don't have public IP addresses assigned to them automatically*\n* *Ensure ECS clusters use Container Insights*\n* *Ensure ECS containers run as non-privileged*\n* *Ensure ECS containers are limited to read-only access to root filesystems*\n\n\n\nCyscale - Your Trusted [Cloud Security Company](https://cyscale.com): \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale offers a comprehensive Cloud Security Platform.
