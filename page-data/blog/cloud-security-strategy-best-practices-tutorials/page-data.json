With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in [multi-cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).

But this year it’s different. \n\nThe rapid and unpredictable rise of AI has drawn attention through all of 2023, leading to questions about the positive and negative impact it will have on lives and businesses going forward.  \n\nThere’s no doubt AI-driven attacks will be a pivotal challenge that defines the cloud security landscape for 2024, but it’s not the only consideration characterized by intricate and cutting-edge vulnerabilities and attacks. \n\nLet's take a close look at the top 10 cloud security challenges we've identified in the last year that need to be closely monitored in 2024 and beyond. \n\n# 1. Advanced AI-driven threats \n\nThroughout 2023, AI exploded as a megatrend that changes the risk landscape significantly – both positively and negatively. We’ve seen AI-powered DDoS attacks, where attackers use automation to adjust threat vectors based on real-time analysis of success against various attack surfaces, and ransomware and malware that can adapt to the environment and replicate using existing and newly discovered vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe potential for generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is a double-edged sword, and the cloud security landscape feels uncertain as attackers come up with more and more sophisticated attacks. \n\nIn 2023, hackers managed to abuse the growing popularity of OpenAI's well-known tool, ChatGPT. [The chatbot was found to be \"hallucinating\"](https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk) in its responses to questions about coding packages and libraries and recommending things that didn't exist.  \n\nHackers went ahead and created malicious packages with the same names, so developers receiving the same recommendations from ChatGPT would download the malicious software. \n\nAlthough the threat is of great concern, it’s not all doom and gloom, according to Google Cloud’s own CISO. While it’s true we expect to see AI help attackers, AI should also give defenders a [significant advantage because AI is good at amplifying capability based on data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-how-the-ai-megatrend-can-help-manage-threats-reduce-toil-and-scale-talent) — and defenders have more data. \n\n## Protecting against AI-driven threats \n\nIn this rapidly changing field, continuous education regarding emerging AI-threats is vital. Awareness campaigns and training are the best weapons against these kinds of attacks. \n\nCloud security solutions such as [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) are also leading the application of AI to make cybersecurity more human friendly. As security practitioners are overwhelmed by information, making sense of that information in terms of context and inference is becoming more of a challenge.  \n\n Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant is a move towards making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\nOur platform can [automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues](https://cyscale.com/blog/introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant/) using the specific customers’ cloud footprint combined with LLMs of vulnerabilities and exploits.     \n\n# 2. Phishing and Social Engineering \n\nHuman behavior remains one of the staples in any list of risks, both as an external threat as well as an internal one due to disgruntled employees.  \n\nAs an external threat, phishing is still one of the most effective attacks. Humans are always the weak link in the security chain, and AI is making defending from social engineering attacks even harder due to the ease with which deep fakes can be produced that appear to be someone you know, to automated, convincing emails, messages, and chats with no grammar errors or that take on the tone and style of a specific person. \n\nIn the cloud, [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) (Identity and Access Management) is the first line of defense when focusing on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets. \n\nLeaked credentials and bypassed authentication processes are very dangerous and can lead to massive disasters, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. \n\n## Protecting against phishing and social engineering attacks \n\nTraining programs for social engineering attacks are necessary to prevent employees from falling for phishing scams.  \n\nEnforcing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is essential. Whether you’re using a passwordless solution or passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone and especially for high-privilege users.   \n\n# 3. Evolving regulatory frameworks \n\nAs technology advances, we see more and more updates and additions to [compliance laws and standards](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/) ensuring both businesses and customer data are adequately protected.  \n\nMaintaining compliance with the increasing complexity of frameworks and benchmarks can become overwhelming very quickly, especially for small teams.  \n\nFor example, in 2023, we saw multiple [updates to CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) for cloud services including Azure, AWS, and Kubernetes.  \n\nFor financial institutions, the implementation deadline for [DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) is also quickly approaching, with the release scheduled for early 2025 (17th of January). \n\nAll told, 2024 is a pivotal year for compliance and companies must keep up with the evolving regulations and maintain a good cloud security posture to protect themselves from emerging cybersecurity threats. \n\n## Maintaining compliance with cloud security regulations and standards \n\nBecause of the ever-changing landscape, staying on top of cloud security compliance is a continuous process that involves regular assessments of your cloud estate and compliance posture.  \n\nYou can keep up to date on new and changing requirements by [reading our blog posts.](https://cyscale.com/blog/compliance/) Furthermore, cloud security solutions like [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) can also help you keep track of your compliance progress and know where you’re standing. \n\n# 4. Quantum computing for password cracking \n\nWidely used encryption algorithms such as RSA were originally designed to withstand traditional computing attack methods, requiring a significant amount of computations to be made in order to crack passwords.  \n\nThe entire cryptographic landscape is currently based on this solution, with RSA protecting sensitive data everywhere. But developments in quantum computing keep advancing and threaten to make the impossible number of computations achievable.  \n\nAs a result, it’s expected that traditional encryption methods might one day become obsolete. The day quantum computing attacks will become possible is named Q-day, and it might be around the corner. \n\n## Protecting against quantum computing attacks \n\nIn parallel with developments in quantum computing, [quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms) or post-quantum cryptography are our only solutions at this time, and the first group of encryption tools that are designed to withstand the assault of a future quantum computer are in development.   \n\n# 5. Complexity in multi-cloud environments \n\nIt’s often said that the real killer in cloud security is the complexity. Cloud platforms and products have evolved in a granular fashion and security has followed suit. One often quoted Gartner prediction is that 99% of cloud security failures through 2025 will be due to user error as admins struggle to keep control of sprawling estates.\n\nCloud service providers offer menus of products and services running into the hundreds, each with their own security configuration, and in a multi-cloud environment this complexity is amplified.  \n\nManaging data security in multi-cloud environments can be especially challenging due to cloud providers' different configurations, security policies, even their vocabulary. As new tools appear, fully understanding a multi-cloud infrastructure can become harder. Remember, a certified AWS cloud expert is not an Azure cloud expert by default, and vice versa.   \n\n## Reducing complexity in multi-cloud environments\n\nBringing all your cloud assets, information, and configurations into one single platform is the key to not getting lost in your own cloud, and this means adopting a security strategy that includes a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) or a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) solution.   \n\nGartner research found that CSPM implementations can reduce cloud security incidents caused by misconfigurations by up to 80%. The single-pane-of-glass view across your multi-cloud estate also cuts down on the need to switch between multiple dashboards and means you can understand your entire cloud inventory in context.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/inventory-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 6. Cybersecurity alert fatigue \n\nStress and burnout are rampant among cybersecurity professionals and the impact of [user fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/) is no secret - thousands of alerts and logs that signal everything and anything that happens in the cloud is not a helpful approach. In many cloud security setups, the default process is to alert for every event, regardless of its criticality.  \n\nThis flood of alerts can quickly become overwhelming for cloud security professionals who become used to severe or critical alerts popping up every day. When everything is critical, nothing is. So, this can desensitize them, and when an actual breach occurs and legitimately critical alerts are sent out, they can end up being overlooked. \n\nThis approach can also turn into a resource hog, giving security practitioners an endless list of tasks to work through that might not achieve the desired results.  \n\n## Protecting against alert fatigue \n\nTo prevent user fatigue, contextual security is the best approach and your ability to prioritize remediation work efficiently depends on the capabilities of your [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) or [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nBy filtering out alerts that are not actually high risk in your unique cloud environment and shifting focus to your own most sensitive cloud resources, you can help your security people work more effectively.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/alerts-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 7. Executive decisions and responsibilities \n\nOne of the biggest challenges a CISO or CTO faces when approaching the board or C suite for funding is justifying their cybersecurity spend. There has long been a perception gap between the cost of security versus the cost of a breach and the simple truth is, you can spend some money up front to reduce the likelihood of a breach, or you can spend more later when the breach has happened.  \n\nThe [global average cost of a data breach has climbed 15% over the last three years](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs) and with lagging investment, only about one third of breaches are picked up by an organization’s own team.  \n\nFurthermore, we’ve seen how decisions made by individuals in executive positions make or break a company through their impact on the company's security strategy. Look at the [SolarWinds case](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/) as an example, where the SolarWinds CISO ended up being investigated for fraud over failure to fully disclose security gaps and issues in the company. \n\nThere’s also the issue of how those responsible for executing on the security strategy are impacted by executive decisions. The SEC investigation into SolarWinds found that “the volume of security issues being identified have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”   \n\n## Empowering security leaders to be effective \n\nAs increasing board liability for risk is sinking in, CTOs, CISOs, and security leaders should be looking to justify their security spend by aligning it with business goals, and instead of operating in a vacuum to build a culture of cybersecurity.  \n\nThis also means formulating policies and establishing processes (and actually following them!) is an approach that all companies need to be doing to ensure employees follow good practices and don't move away from established rules. \n\n# 8. Insider threats and privilege misuse \n\nSometimes, it's easy to focus on preventing unwanted access from external actors and forgetting that harm can also be done from the inside. Malicious or unintentional actions by employees with privileged access can pose significant security risks. \n\nEstimates vary but most research agrees that more than half of security breaches experienced are a result of internal threats or abuse of privilege. \n\n## Protecting against insider threats \n\nTo prevent against damage caused by current or previous employees, ensure that: \n\n* When offboarding users, you're removing all access and not leaving any dangling permissions that can be abused, \n* You're following the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only assigning the necessary permissions for the amount of time required, \n* You're monitoring user activity and performing regular assessments of user access and permissions. \n\n# 9. Cryptographic keys management \n\nManaging encryption keys effectively is critical for safeguarding data. With the growing volume of encrypted data in the cloud, ensuring secure storage, access, rotation, and revocation of encryption keys has become challenging. \n\nWhy is the way you store and manage cryptographic keys so important? A good example is the leak of 38TB of secrets that occurred in 2023, when a GitHub repository owned by Microsoft’s AI research division provided a link to a misconfigured Azure storage resource. \n\n[Microsoft AI Researchers exposed](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-ai-accidently-leaked-38tb/) crypto keys, passwords, and other data through a storage account that could be accessed using leaked SAS (Shared Access Signature) tokens. If encryption keys are leaked, the effort of encrypting data goes to waste. \n\nAnd it’s not just about protecting data but maintaining access to it. If an encryption key expires before it’s rotated out, you could end up losing access to precious data.  \n\n## Effective cryptographic keys management \n\nAs part of an effective CSPM approach, you need a solid crypto key management strategy. Cloud security platforms like Cyscale check a wide palette of settings using security controls across multiple cloud service providers to ensure keys on different platforms remain secure. \n\nA few examples are: \n\n* Ensure encryption keys are not expiring within the next 14 days \n* Ensure encryption keys don't have permissive access policies \n* Ensure in-use encryption keys are not scheduled for deletion \n* Ensure Cloud KMS cryptokeys are not anonymously or publicly accessible \n\n  <video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 10. Incident Response \n\nPreventative cybersecurity measures will only take you so far. Developing and implementing robust incident response plans specific to cloud environments is essential.  \n\nAccording to the [annual M-Trends report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/m-trends-2023) by Mandiant, part of Google, global median dwell time was down to 16 days in 2023 from 21 the year before, meaning attacks are being detected more quickly than ever before.  \n\nAlthough this decrease is in part down to better tools and better approaches by defenders, an explosion in ransomware is also driving this number down as the point of these attacks is to make themselves known for extortion purposes.  \n\nSo, when it comes to responding to an active incident, speed is of the essence.  \n\n## Effective incident response in cloud security \n\nGiven the volume of tasks and pressure on human resources, automation can take a lot of the toil out of triage, prioritization, and remediation when it comes to detecting and acting on incidents.  \n\nEffective coordination, timely response to security incidents, and comprehensive recovery strategies are vital for minimizing damage and restoring operations. \n\nFinally, while resumption of normal operations is the priority, care should also be taken to preserve evidence during the recovery and remediation phases. In some cases this may even be a regulatory requirement.  \n\n## Challenges and opportunities in 2024: Adapting amid technological shifts   \n\nThe challenges of 2024 bring forward a landscape where technological advancements intertwine with vulnerabilities, creating a need for adaptable and comprehensive security strategies.  \n\nAs we navigate AI-driven threats, the looming potential of quantum computing, and growing multi-cloud environments, hackers find ever-more innovative ways to attack companies, and so we must focus on fortifying our defenses, meaning proactive measures become imperative. \n\nTo prepare for this changing landscape, book a free cloud security health assessment with Cyscale. Get complete visibility of your entire cloud estate in minutes and assess your cloud security posture, so you can expose, understand, and prioritize any threats. \n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image'/>\n</a>\n\n## Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment.

This means you can retrieve and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket, preventing deletion or overwriting of that object. \n\nIn a business that often creates new buckets, or updates objects in storage frequently, Cyscale’s custom controls would [check that the buckets are correctly configured](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). Without this check an organization could easily lose sensitive or important data. This is clearly something a significant portion of our customer base is concerned with. \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Reduce cloud security assessments from weeks to minutes \n\nSpeed is of the essence too. Although we were unable to draw averages from our customer base due to their wildly different internal processes, we were able to establish that broadly speaking, it can take a company up to two weeks to do the necessary data gathering and analysis to identify and assess misconfigurations on cloud resources like buckets. \n\nThis is before a manual prioritization of issues, considered against the company's specific operational and compliance requirements. \n\nWhat we could establish universally however, is that a customer using Cyscale was able to onboard their cloud environments (such as AWS) and perform their first scan to identify any misconfigured S3 buckets within 15 minutes.  \n\nThe [prioritization of identified issues happens in real-time](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) based on custom controls, eg. an S3 bucket discovered without versioning enabled would be flagged as a high-priority alert immediately. \n\nThis reduces a highly manual process taking two weeks, down to a highly automated 15 minutes.  \n\n## Cloud risk reduction of up to 70% \n\nOverall, we were able to reduce our customers’ cloud risk by an average of 16%. While this may not sound a lot, it takes into account many frequently changing cloud estates, where Cyscale is constantly surfacing new issues. We must also consider the rapid development of the Cyscale platform itself, which surfaces new issues as capabilities are deployed.  \n\nOne customer did in fact see a 70% reduction in risk, which speaks to our mission of being able to point you towards the top 20-30% of issues that will significantly reduce your risk.  \n\nThis finding is also a nod to the time saved by instantly seeing where vulnerable images and code are running within your infrastructure and making those findings prominent, reducing alert fatigue. \n\nEvery customer’s cloud infrastructure is unique, so it’s hard to draw common benefits, but since [we introduced the Scopes feature](https://cyscale.com/blog/major-update-cyscale/) earlier this year, many customers have reported architecture improvements carried out by leveraging asset graphs after segmenting their workloads into useful groups with Scopes.  \n\n## Tuesday is the day for security tasks  \n\nFinally, what would a year in review be without an interesting fact? While we were looking at our data set, one day of the week stood out as the most popular day for getting cloud security tasks ticked off, and that was Tuesday.  \n\nWhat is it about Tuesdays that make them the preferred day for productivity? We can’t say for sure, but we do know one customer topped the productivity leaderboard one particular Tuesday, by breezing through over 4,800 remediations.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Find unused cloud resources and save money \n\nThat’s not all though. If we dive into the data, there’s more to add to the big picture from small victories achieved by our customers that cannot be measured as easily. \n\nPeriodic IAM (Identity and Access Management) reviews can be accelerated and, in some cases, mostly automated, as Cyscale identifies excessive permissions, left-over users that need offboarding, and optimizes user management by revealing overprivileged accounts or entitlements that are not in use.  \n\nAnd there is also a great opportunity for cloud security solutions like Cyscale to help reduce your cloud infrastructure costs by identifying left-over and unused resources, as well as shadow infrastructure that has crept into your estate without your knowledge.\n\n<a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><img src=\"/img/wrapped-email.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"The MSSP Opportunity: Capturing Demand for Cloud Security","seoTitle":"The MSSP Opportunity: Capturing Demand for Cloud Security","description":"Demand for cloud operations and cybersecurity as-a-service shows no sign of letting up.

Cyber skills are in short supply and corresponding experience in cloud and cyber remains years out. Meanwhile the tech landscape continues to evolve at a dizzying pace, with explosive innovations like generative AI bringing new and unknown risks for companies struggling to keep pace with developments.   \n\nFor Managed Service Providers (MSPs) this creates a perfect opportunity to meet growing demand by adding cloud security to your services portfolio, providing additional value to new and existing clients, and generating more revenue in a persistently gloomy economy.  \n\nFor managed service and value add players, three key factors are at play: \n\n* **Organizations are struggling to hire technical talent** – this includes both cloud expertise and cybersecurity expertise \n* **Organizations are already bought into the as-a-Service delivery model** – this includes operational services as well as applications/software \n* **Organizations are desperate for education in cybersecurity** – this includes both established companies undergoing a digital transformation into an unfamiliar environment and young companies that don’t have the budget or the resources to skill up \n\n## Technology adoption is outpacing in-house capabilities \n\nIndustry association and advisory firm the Technology & Services Industry Association (TSIA) makes the root of the demand for these cyber skills very clear in its [State of Managed Services 2023](https://www.tsia.com/resources/the-state-of-managed-services-2023?) report, when it points out that today, *every* company is a technology company.  \n\nThere was a time when ‘technology companies’ stood alone from the financial companies, healthcare companies, or media companies. Now all companies in all sectors share one common thread evident in the emergence of new sector-specific innovators, such as fintechs and healthtechs, and that common thread is adoption of the cloud.   \n\nThe rapid adoption of cloud technology has had a significant knock-on effect however, in that it has become common practice to leverage IT outsourcing or managed services to support a shortfall in internal skills. \n\nThe great promise of the cloud was to enable everything on-demand, but in delivery, the speed of innovation has far outpaced most companies’ ability to keep up. This means external support is sought to help with cost reduction, risk aversion, transition from capital expenditure (CapEx) to operating expenditure (OpEx), or to try and accelerate return on investment in that technology.  \n\nAs a result, over 50% of respondents in S&P Global/451 Research's [Voice of the Enterprise: Cloud, Hosting & Managed Services, Managed Services 2022](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/managed-services-market-forecast-managed-cloud-services-coming-to-the-fore) survey said they currently relied on managed service providers to support their cloud environments. And this appetite is growing. \n\nApplication services including cybersecurity; operational services; and disaster recovery (backup and archiving) ranked as the top three managed services deployed in conjunction with public cloud deployments. \n\nFurthermore, managed services for cloud are not seen as a stopgap measure but as a long-term solution, with 73% of those companies currently using managed services for cloud apps and data, expecting to rely more on managed services over time. And nearly nine in 10 agree that managed\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/resources/empowering-mssps.pdf\"><img src=\"/img/cloud-security-mssps-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Get the Cyscale Cloud Security Platform for MSSPs Datasheet\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:33.75rem;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n## From MSP to MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) \n\nWhere the purpose of an MSP approach is to make IT systems or functions run smoother while adhering to security best practices, an MSSP’s mission is to zero-in on the security aspect and improve the operation of a business environment by directly seeking out, identifying, and mitigating risk.  \n\nAs a specialized third party, an MSSP can alleviate the strain on IT teams, as well as provide necessary skills and insight to support and expand operations. A typical MSSP portfolio might include: \n\n* Managed firewall \n* Intrusion detection \n* Virtual Private Network (VPN) \n* Vulnerability scanning \n* Antivirus \n* Cloud security \n\nIn order to best capitalize on the opportunity, MSSPs actively seek to provide clients with real-time threat detection, response, and remediation services. A successful MSSP approach requires: \n\n* The right portfolio of tools that can not only deliver what the customer demands, but in a way that is effective and efficient for the MSSP \n* Experienced operational and technical staff with the right skill sets to operate on behalf of multiple end clients through comprehensive procedures and protocols \n* A Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor, prevent, detect, investigate, and remediate cyber threats 24/7 \n* A commitment to the MSSP business model \n\nThese last two points go hand-in-hand. According to Computer Weekly’s Evolving Landscape of the MSP Business 2023 report, the most in-demand products are a mix of cybersecurity and cloud solutions, with 85% of MSP respondents seeing an increasing need to offer full-fledged solutions such as SOC as-a-service. This is because under-resourced organizations are looking for end-to-end coverage, including risk prevention, detection, and remediation when it comes to cloud security.  \n\nFor those that already have a comprehensive portfolio, the rewards are bountiful, with the same report finding that MSPs are expecting average growth of 33% in 2023. \n\nIn combining the two biggest revenue drivers – cloud and security - the approach with most opportunity for established and budding MSSPs is to use lightweight agentless scanning solutions to build an inventory of the customer’s cyber-estate and surface actionable issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other risks. Then use this information to sell remediation services.  \n\nContinuous monitoring of the estate can make this an ongoing relationship, and a repeat revenue generator covering the full spectrum of threat prevention, detection, and remediation.  \n\n**Unlock new revenue streams with Cyscale's MSSP Cloud Security Platform**\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">LEARN MORE</button></a></div>\n\n## Where technology goes, risk follows \n\nFor customers with multi- and hybrid-cloud infrastructures, there is also the opportunity for an MSSP with a well put together service package to deliver a layer of abstraction that reduces the complexity for customers working across multiple dashboards and interfaces.  \n\nAWS claims that around 75% of its top 2,000 customers use AWS Security Hub as the central platform to consolidate security findings from their AWS cloud environments. But AWS faces growing competition from cloud rivals Microsoft and Google, both of which have invested heavily in their own cloud-native offerings. \n\nThe point is that with every cloud provider taking its own unique approach, organizations need extensive resources in terms of people and skills to manage these increasingly complex systems, each with their own native tools. An AWS security expert is not an Azure security expert, and the effort to remain an AWS ‘expert’ is not inconsiderable for a small company. This makes an independent third-party with multi-cloud tools and multi-cloud expertise a very attractive proposition.  \n\nCyscale can confirm that almost 50% of our inbound enquiries over 2023 have come from MSPs and MSSPs looking to add or expand their cloud security offerings with comprehensive coverage for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes, and multi-client management through a single pane of glass features as a top priority.  \n\n## Capitalizing on the MSSP opportunity \n\nIn The State of Technology Services 2023, the TSIA notes that managed services is one of the top three growth engines within the tech industry, boasting a sustainable margin and double-digit operating income. \n\nOne of the key drivers here, especially for cybersecurity as-a-service, is more awareness at the board level that security is a critical investment to make. This is compounded by worsening talent issues due to today's complex economic environment, and short-staffed teams that must find ways to do more with less. \n\nFor those ready to grab the opportunity, the path to profitable as-a-service solutions is through a managed as-a-service offer that can be standardized in order to become scalable, repeatable, and profitable. \n\nFor organizations operating in the cloud with limited time and security resources, simple and effective security must be a priority, and MSSPs equipped with a comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity and data management solutions are uniquely positioned to solve this challenge for repeat clients. \n\n## Drive new business with a cloud security assessment  \n\nMSSPs can create new business opportunities by using the Cyscale cloud security platform to offer up-front assessments of a customer or prospect’s entire cloud estate.  \n\nA fully automated security assessment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Kubernetes assets will provide you with comprehensive insights into your clients’ infrastructure vulnerabilities in a matter of minutes. \n\nAn easy-to-understand report can then be used to make the case for additional remediation and monitoring services to both technical stakeholders such as CTOs, CISOs, and security engineers, as well as more business-minded executives such as CFOs and CEOs.

This is why effective cyber due diligence is essential for all involved, including situations where there will not be a merging or integration of systems, such as with the acquisition of a firm by private equity (PE) for example.  \n\n## Technology: Opportunity or risk? \n\nIn recent years mindsets have shifted, and companies no longer see technology as a cost of doing business as part of the M&A process, but instead as a way of accelerating growth or getting ahead in a market.  \n\n[PWC notes that technology is empowering CEOs to digitalise and transform businesses,](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html) and AI has changed the game, with a disruptive impact that will create M&A opportunities as both corporates and private equity firms move to acquire new businesses or potentially exit them to monetize returns.  \n\n“We’ve been seeing for some time the growing skills challenge faced by organisations driving acquisition strategies. AI has upped the game here too, with AI talent being one of the scarcest resources to find,” PWC said in its 2023 mid-year update on Global M&A Industry Trends. \n\n[According to Accenture,](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/mapping-dna-mergers-acquisitions-value) 74% of CEOs see tech integration in M&A as a growth enabler or source of competitive advantage, but only 21% say tech due diligence was conducted for most of their deals over the past three years (to 2022).  \n\nThe obvious issue here becomes even more clear when the same report finds that 96% of CIOs have seen tech due diligence uncover issues or opportunities that made a material impact on the deal.  \n\n## Cybersecurity due diligence in M&A \n\nIt seems to be the case that one aspect that's often overlooked, yet fundamentally critical in the M&A process, is comprehensive planning for the integration of IT systems, including cloud environments.  \n\nIt’s possible that lack of education plays a role here, especially in cases where a company is being acquired for its technology by a more established acquirer built on legacy systems looking to keep pace with the market.  \n\nWhile it may not look complicated from the outside, it is not the case that merging two cloud-based organizations, even when both are using the same cloud provider, will ease the integration.  \n\nThe same is true when the merger will create a hybrid environment mixing on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.  \n\nEither way, integrating a new cloud environment can introduce a lot of new misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in both directions. This article intends to explore why the M&A process needs to be addressed as a cloud security challenge just as much, if not more, as an operational challenge. \n\n## Approaching cybersecurity proactively during M&A  \n\nIdeally, a full cybersecurity audit, including cloud security, will be carried out as part of the due diligence phase of a merger or acquisition. And in cases where there is to be a merging of infrastructure, an audit should again be carried out on day zero of the integration. \n\nThe negative consequences of failing to comprehensively assess your cloud security include: \n\n* Reputational risks and damage to brand \n* Increased costs down the road, either from the integration itself, lost revenue, or fines for compliance failings or security breaches \n* Failure to comply with existing or newly acquired compliance overheads, regional laws and regulations, resulting in fines or increased spend  \n* Overlooked or lost intellectual property, especially relevant due to the boom in AI and associated tech IP \n* Customer impact including increased friction and churn due to broken or problematic systems \n\n## Common misconceptions when integrating a new cloud environment  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n* **We both use the same cloud platform so the integration will be easy:** Unique configurations, architectures, and approaches mean that no two cloud environments are alike, even on the same platform. \n* **We’re mostly on-prem so it’s just adding a new technology:** The cloud is a wildly different environment to anything that has come before and even now there is a significant shortage of experience and expertise in the market. Many security problems arise from a lack of education about how to operate safely in the cloud.  \n* **We will audit the cloud environment at a later date:** Due to its public nature, security incidents in the cloud happen in real time. A new zero-day vulnerability in a common software package can be exploited on a mass scale hours after being revealed. A DevOps team spinning up a new instance with a misconfiguration can open your entire infrastructure up to risk. Cloud security posture has to be monitored constantly.  \n* **We can rely on our existing toolset or expertise:** The difference from one cloud platform to another is considerable. They even use different terminology. An expert in AWS is not necessarily an expert in Azure, and security tools may not comprehensively cover multiple environments. The introduction of another cloud is the introduction of another risk, and another visibility challenge.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>\n\n## Cloud security risks that come with an M&A event: Real examples \n\n### Data leakage \n\nWhen moving data from one cloud service provider to another, mistakes are bound to happen. In one case a company was moving some sensitive files from AWS S3 buckets to an Azure Storage Account.  \n\nDuring the migration, the team utilized Shared Access Signatures (SAS) in Azure to control access to the stored data. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of the migration process, the team hastily generated SAS tokens with overly broad permissions. \n\nInstead of applying fine-grained access controls to specific resources or limiting access to authorized personnel, the tokens granted broader read and write permissions across a wider range of containers or blobs within the Azure Storage Account. \n\nThis misconfiguration inadvertently exposed sensitive data, including financial records and proprietary algorithms. \n\n**Solution:** Even though a migration can be daunting, take it step by step and understand the [best practices of cloud resources](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) you’re using so you can make informed decisions. For example, in the case of storage accounts in Azure, a recommendation is to use RBAC (Role-based access control), rather than SAS signatures.  \n\nIt’s not enough to understand the technology you’ve been using to date, you also need to have a good grasp of the new cloud provider you’re integrating with as every cloud’s approach is different.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\"><img src=\"/img/data-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n### Attempting integration of incompatible systems \n\nHarmonizing disparate IT systems, particularly cloud environments, is a formidable challenge in M&A events. Incompatible technologies can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit.  \n\nIn one case two companies performed encryption for PII differently, and when they ultimately had to merge the sensitive data from two different repositories, the data had to be decrypted and then re-encrypted in a unified manner. This opened up the possibility of several risks – what happens to the data while it’s unencrypted? And where is it stored?  \n\n**Solution:** When it comes to sensitive data, such as PII, time is of the essence but it’s more important to do the work properly, so don’t rush to process it and skip steps. \n\nMinimize the time data is unencrypted. Decrypt the data only when necessary for the merge and re-encrypt it promptly after the process is complete. Moreover, perform the decryption and re-encryption within a secure, controlled environment with restricted access. Use encrypted communication channels and isolated systems to prevent unauthorized access to the unencrypted data. \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\">\n  <img src=\"/img/encryption-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:32.0625rem;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'> See how Cyscale solved this challenge by revealing encryption status for data <br class=\"hidden lg:block\">\n    and identifying misconfigurations in data stores</span>\n</a>\n\n### Lack of visibility into the extended cloud estate \n\nOne of the big problems that often appears during or after a merger or an acquisition is the lack of visibility into the new or extended cloud estate. When you have to deal with complex infrastructures and unknown environments, security issues can creep in without you noticing. Roles or permissions that should be onboarded or offboarded, redundant VMs that have to be deprovisioned, storage resources that have to be deleted, these are just some examples of cloud resources that may change during an M&A.  \n\nWithout great visibility into a changing environment, mistakes are bound to happen. \n\n**Solution:** To gain much-needed visibility in the cloud, have an active inventory of all your cloud resources and assets, and ideally, the context of how they all interconnect. There are tools which will automatically scan your estate and build an inventory, and some use dashboards to help visualize your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) even across multiple clouds. \n\nFurthermore, perform access reviews to thoroughly understand the permissions users have and whether they are overprovisioned or even redundant.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#inventory\">\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'>See how Cyscale gives you full visibility of your cloud estate by revealing all assets \n    and their issues in minutes</span>\n</a>\n\n### Expanding compliance and regulatory challenges \n\nM&A events can often cross multiple geographic or legal jurisdictions, each with its own set of compliance requirements. Ensuring alignment with these diverse regulatory landscapes can be a daunting task, and failure to meet compliance standards can lead to severe penalties and legal consequences. \n\nFor example, for some companies, data sovereignty is an important aspect. This means that some companies, due to compliance requirements, have to store all data related to a specific geography on that country’s territory. If one organization acquired another to get access to a new market, they must ensure continued compliance with data sovereignty requirements in the event of merging of infrastructure or face possible legal battles and substantial fines.  \n\nCommon examples include the applicability of US State Privacy Laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other state-specific laws. Or the applicability of EU/UK GDPR and other international laws, all of which highlight the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of regulatory environments and meticulous due diligence in M&A scenarios. \n\n**Solution:** When an M&A event happens, ensure that you understand the compliance requirements related to all parties and create a detailed plan to minimize any disruption from the merger or integration process.  \n\nIn terms of data sovereignty, this means understanding how to store data in the country where it’s supposed to be stored.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#compliance\">\n    <img src=\"/img/compliance-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:38.563rem;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='block text-center'>See how Cyscale helps you comply with dozens of standards out of the box\n    and offers support for custom controls</span>\n</a>\n\n### See how we build an asset inventory in this video\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQj8Yo71DvQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n## Approaching cloud security in M&A holistically  \n\nAlthough the considerations set out in this article make an M&A event seem daunting, going into the process with an understanding of what to look out for is half the battle. Proper planning and a comprehensive assessment of your cloud infrastructure(s) during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merge will ensure the process runs smoothly and safely. \n\nThe Cyscale platform is designed to help close these security gaps by providing continuous visibility, security controls, and a single dashboard through which to assess your security posture across multiple clouds, including policies and compliance.  \n\n### Preparing for M&A with a cloud security assessment \n\nThe Cyscale cloud security platform is an agentless cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that can help you assess risk during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merger and integration.  \n\n<strong id=\"inventory\">Inventory</strong>\n\nTo start with, a fully automated security assessment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Kubernetes assets will provide you with comprehensive insights into your partner’s cloud estate, including all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, in a matter of minutes.  \n\nThis will give you a full asset inventory and flag any urgent issues that need to be addressed. The Cyscale Graph View means that misconfigurations are analyzed in context, automatically correlating issues that affect compute, data storage and identity assets, determining their real impact on data security and helping prioritize remediation efforts. \n\n<strong id=\"data\">Data</strong>\n\nThe assessment will also identify all data stores and give you valuable information about encryption status for data at rest, encryption keys, as well as identifying any object containers and databases with issues, such as public access, permissive access policies, or lack of deletion protection.  \n\nThis can help ensure your crown jewels are protected, prevent data leakage, and ensure solid foundations for tasks like merging encrypted databases.  \n\n<strong id=\"compliance\">Compliance</strong>\n\nIn terms of both planning the integration work and having ongoing proof of compliance, Cyscale has in-app support for dozens of compliance standards, including CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST and more. \n\nAll these compliance standards and controls are analyzed within the Cyscale app, taking into account the unique cloud infrastructures and their related vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nThis consolidates your reputation as a transparent, data-focused organization that proves to customers, auditors, and regulatory compliance bodies how robustly it protects Personally Identifiable Information (PII). \n\nAn easy-to-understand report can then be used to make the case for additional funding or remediation requirements, for both technical stakeholders such as CTOs, CISOs, and security engineers, as well as more business-minded executives such as CFOs, CEOs or the Board.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/request-demo/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image'/>\n</a>"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["120001781","2199015418","220583031","3058837307","3355083976","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
