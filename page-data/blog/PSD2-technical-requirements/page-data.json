A recent Insider Intelligence [report](https://www.emarketer.com/content/insider-intelligence-fintech-trends-watch-2022) shows that the global funding for fintech in the first three quarters of 2021 reached $94.7 billion, which is shy of the total for 2019 and 2020 combined. [In the UK](https://member.fintech.global/2021/12/15/uk-fintech-funding-nearly-doubled-in-the-first-three-quarters-of-2021-outpacing-global-average/) alone, fintech funding nearly doubled in the mentioned timeframe, as compared to the year before (2020).\n\nAround the fintech businesses, entire ecosystems have emerged. There are national as well as international level organizations that collaborate and launch initiatives to drive the competition as well as innovation in the sector. Regulatory bodies are part of the ecosystems as well, making sure that businesses are doing the best they can to protect fintech consumers.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to take a deeper look at the most important regulations for payment services (which is a large subset of fintech services) in Europe, trying to showcase the security requirements for the technology at the core of these businesses, its governance included.\n\nWe keep in mind that although the UK has left the European Union, they decided to adopt a great part of the regulation under their legislation as well.\n\n## The PSD2 Directive\n\nProbably the most important European regulation that impacts fintech is the PSD2 Directive. Developed by the European Parliament and the European Council, introduced in 2015, and enforced since 2018, it describes rules, rights and obligations of Payment Service Providers and the users of these services. In the next sections, we go through the structure of the document, emphasizing the articles that regulate the “tech” in “fintech”.\n\nIt starts with 113 points that set up the context for the regulation and then follows with 6 main sections (also called titles).\n\n### Scope\n\n**The first section** clarifies the subject matter (who is affected), and that is Payment Service Providers. As we’ll see below, this includes traditional financial services providers, for example banks, but also new providers, such as fintechs. There’s also an article regarding scope: it applies to payment services provided within the European Union.\n\nPayment Service Providers are grouped under 6 distinct categories, but most fintechs fall under **payment institutions** and **electronic money institutions**.\n\nAny institution that provides payment services (enumerated below) after being authorized to do so, becomes a **payment institution**.\n\nThe different types of **payment services**, as understood from Annex 1 of the Directive are:\n\n-   operating a payment account for a user\n-   placing or withdrawing cash from a payment account\n-   payment transactions (i.e. transfers of funds) within the same provider, or to an external provider\n-   issuing of payment cards\n-   issuing sets of rules agreed between the issuer and the user that are then used to initiate a payment\n-   accepting and processing payment transactions\n-   money remittance, which is transfer of money without any payment accounts being created or used (think Western Union)\n-   payment initiation — initiate payment orders on behalf of the user (with his previous consent), from a payment account that is held at a different provider. This is possible due to the open banking framework.\n-   account information — provides information on payment accounts held by the user at a different provider. Again, this service has been made possible through open banking.\n\nAn **electronic money institution** is a legal entity that is authorized to issue electronic money. An electronic money institution can at the same time be a payment institution. There is a specific authorization license for each of these types of providers.\n\n### Becoming a PSP\n\n**The second section**, or title, adds further provisions for Payment Service Providers, including the procedure to become licensed as one.\n\n_Article 5_, titled “Applications for authorization”, contains the list of artefacts to submit when applying to become a payment institution. Among these, the directive requires **a security policy document** that must contain \"a detailed risk assessment\", along with the \"security control and mitigation measures taken\" to protect users against identified risk. It also explicitly states that the policy must indicate how the institution ensures \"a high level of **technical security and data protection**, including of the software and IT systems used\", and even when these are entirely or partly outsourced.\n\nAs we can see, already during the application process, a fintech business must have technical security controls in-place, as well as ways to describe them.\n\n**The third section** (title) of the directive refers to the transparency of conditions, as well as information requirements for payment service providers, meaning data regarding the payments which must be communicated to the service user at specific points in time. It does not contain any requirements for tech.\n\n### Proper Security\n\n**The fourth section** (title) details the rights and obligations around the provision and use of payment services, of both the providers and the users. This section is again relevant for those in charge of technology inside fintech companies providing payment services.\n\n*Article 66* and *Article 67* describe the obligations of PISPs (Payment Initiation Service Providers) and AISPs (Account Information Service Providers), which are both types of payment service providers.\n\nAn example of a PISP would be an application that, based on previously given user consent, makes regular (i.e. monthly) payments from the user’s bank account, and invests those funds on behalf of the user. In other words, by providing payment initiation services, the app makes payment transactions without the user having to do anything.\n\nTo understand an AISP, think of an application that queries information about a user’s bank account and then analyzes that data in order to give the user insights about his financial behavior. Previously given user consent is, of course, mandatory.\n\nUnder PSD2, the PISP and the AISP must:\n\n-   Protect user's personalized security credentials (PSC), if used, by transmitting them safely, and making sure they are not shared with other parties.\n\n    **PSCs** are, for example, your internet banking password, the code you use to authenticate to your neobank's mobile app, or any other means of authenticating with a Payment Service Provider. These credentials should not be shared with a PISP, or, when they are, they must be handled securely.\n\n-   Ensure that any information received about the payment service user is only provided to the payee (with user consent)\n-   When communicating with the entity that provides the user's payment account (i.e the bank), use common and secure open standards of communication\n-   Not store sensitive payment data of the user\n-   Not request from the user data that is not needed, in order to provide the services\n-   Not use, access, or store any user data for purposes other than the provided service\n-   In case of payment transactions, not modify the transaction amount\n\n*Article 70* states the obligations of a Payment Service Provider in relation to payment instruments (remember, these may be payment cards, but also procedures agreed between the user and the service provider on how to initiate payment orders). Again, the protection of personalized security credentials is required, by making sure that they are not accessible to other parties.\n\n*Article 74* states that when a Payment Service Provider doesn’t enforce strong customer authentication (**SCA**; think MFA) to protect transactions, it is liable for any financial losses incurred by the payer because of that.\n\n*Article 89* details the liability of Payment Service Providers in case they fail to correctly and in-time execute payment transactions. This part stresses out the importance of a solid **business continuity policy** and plan.\n\n*Article 95* requires two things from the Payment Service Providers:\n\n-   mitigation measures and control mechanisms in place, to manage operational and security risks\n-   to regularly provide operational and security risk assessments to competent authorities, as well as evidence that mitigation measures are adequate\n\n_Article 97_ requires from the PSP the implementation of strong customer authentication, meaning multi-factor authentication, involving something the user knows, something the user possesses or something that the user is (knowledge, possession or inherence). It also requires that “payment service providers have in place adequate security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of payment service users’ personalized security credentials”.\n\n### Ending Notes\n\nFinally, *Article 98* requires that, by July 2017, the Euro Bank Association (which is another EU institution) will have drafted regulatory technical standards to address the security requirements from previous articles (strong customer authentication and protecting the users’ personalized security credentials).\n\nThe **last two sections** refer to procedures for the settlement of disputes, user information rights, and final provisions, respectively, but neither of them contains additional technical requirements.\n\nThe regulatory technical standards developed by the EBA will be the subject of the next article in the series, where we will take a deeper dive into what they mean for a fintech.\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5.
