Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Compliance"],"title":"Understanding the NIS2 Directive: Boosting Cloud Security and Compliance","seoTitle":"Understanding the NIS2 Directive: Boosting Cloud Security and Compliance","description":"NIS2 (Network and Information Systems Security Directive 2) is a regulatory framework destined to strengthen cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and service providers.

It builds upon the NIS 1 Directive, which regulates network and information systems security. NIS2 was created by the European Union to enforce a modern cybersecurity strategy, having in mind new sectors and improving incident response and resilience in compliant entities. NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) came into effect on the 16th of January 2023 and replaces NIS1, which was released in 2016. \n\n## Differences between NIS 1 and NIS 2 \n\nAiming to improve the NIS1 Directive, its newer version has a few differences. Some of the key ones are: \n\n* NIS2 now covers more sectors than NIS1, which focused on essential services operators in sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare. NIS2 also has cloud computing services in scope. Some examples of the newly added sectors are postal and courier services, waste management, digital providers. \n* Security controls are more stringent for NIS2. A few topics covered for the cloud are data encryption, IAM, vulnerability management, zero trust principles, and incident response. \n* Penalties no longer differ from country to country like they did in NIS1; they are harmonized across the European Union. \n\n## Key elements of NIS2 \n\nAll entities in scope should take measures to cover the most important elements, considered by NIS2 as the baseline for protecting the network, information systems, and physical environment from cybersecurity incidents. The following are the mandatory measures: \n\n* Policies on risk analysis and information system security, \n* Incident handling, \n* Business continuity, \n* Supply chain security, \n* Security in network and information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance, \n* Policies to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures, \n* Basic cyber hygiene practices and training, \n* Policies regarding the use of cryptography and encryption, \n* HR security, access control policies, access management, \n* The use of MFA or continuous authentication solutions. \n\nYou can find more details about these requirements directly from [the NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). \n\nThe NIS2 is crucial for implementing cybersecurity best practices and protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations can mitigate risks and contribute to a safer digital environment by adopting the mentioned requirements.  \n\n## F﻿AQ on NIS2 Directive\n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What is the goal of the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">It aims to enhance cybersecurity resilience for the EU's critical infrastructure and digital service providers.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Who does the NIS2 Directive apply to?</p><p class=\"answer\">It applies to entities that provide essential or important services to the European economy from different sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, finance, but not limited to those.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How does the NIS2 Directive affect cloud providers?</p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud providers must implement robust security measures to comply with the directive and protect services from cyber threats.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What happens if you don't comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">Non-compliance can lead to penalties such as fines and sanctions, along with increased cyber risks and disruptions to critical services.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How can organizations comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">By conducting risk assessments, implementing security controls, establishing incident response procedures, and promoting cybersecurity awareness.</p></li></ul>\n\n[You can perform a free risk assessment right now](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/) to see where your company stands in terms of cloud security and find out the most actionable insights that can improve your business’ cloud security posture. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Engineering","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Secrets Management in Kubernetes: Essential Insights and Best Practices","seoTitle":"Secrets Management in Kubernetes: Essential Insights and Best Practices","description":"Secrets Management is always a hot topic nowadays.

Choosing the correct encryption algorithm, storing secrets in the right service, setting access to them; these are all actions that can make it or break it for your infrastructure.   \n\nIn this article, we will not only discuss how you should manage secrets in Kubernetes, but also help you understand why all these protection measures are vital for your Kubernetes clusters. \n\n## Secrets in Kubernetes \n\nSecrets are objects that contain keys, passwords, tokens. We're talking API keys, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, and others. Hackers dream of these every day and they put all their efforts into stealing them, so why wouldn’t you do the same, but for protecting them? \n\nHowever, even if they are the crown jewel of your Kubernetes cluster, they are actually stored unencrypted on etcd. That’s right. Anyone with access to etcd, as well as anyone with API access can retrieve (or even modify) a Secret. Moreover, [according to CNCF](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), anyone who is authorized to create a Pod in a namespace can also read any Secret in the namespace. So, we’ve already found two big problems: Secrets are stored unencrypted, and a lot of users can have access to them if you’re not implementing the Least Privilege Principle (which you can read more about [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)). Let’s see how to solve these issues. \n\n## Secrets Management Checklist \n\n### At rest encryption \n\nArguably the first step to securing secrets is encrypting them. At rest encryption ensures confidentiality. This means that if attackers get ahold of your secrets, they will not be able to read them unless they decrypt them. With [good key management and an appropriate cryptographic algorithm](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), you can keep attackers at bay. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo enable secret encryption at rest in EKS, you must: \n\n1. Navigate to the EKS console. You can click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters). \n2. Select the cluster for which you want to enable secret encryption. \n3. Under **Overview**, navigate to **Secrets Encryption** and select **Enable**. \n4. Choose a key from the drop-down list and select **Enable**. If you don’t already have a key, you must create one and return to this window. \n\nYou can also turn on secrets encryption for your Kubernetes clusters using this command: \n\n```html\naws eks associate-encryption-config --cluster-name <clusterName> --encryption-config '\\[{\"resources\":[\"secrets\"],\"provider\":{\"keyArn\":\"arn:aws:kms:<regionCode>:<account>:key/<key>\"}}]'\n```\n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo turn on KMS etcd encryption for an existing cluster, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <keyID>\n```\n\nThis enables secret encryption using a publicly reachable Azure Key Vault. It assumes you already have an encryption key and a managed identity configured to allow access to the key. [Our article](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/) explains more about Azure Key Vault and its configuration options. \n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nIn Google Cloud, Kubernetes secrets are encrypted at rest by default. However, you can turn on secrets encryption at the application layer. Here is how you can do it: \n\n1. Navigate to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console by clicking [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?_ga=2.113700551.1182343565.1709535826-1724752788.1707736657). \n2. Under **Security**, select the **Edit Application-layer Secrets Encryption** button. \n3. Select the **Enable Application-layer secrets encryption** checkbox and choose the key you want to use. \n4. Select **Save changes**. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\n1. **To begin the process of encrypting your secrets at rest**, generate an encryption key. You can use a Key Vault or a KMS to do this. Then, you need to create a configuration file. Here is an example provided by CNCF: \n\n```html\napiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: EncryptionConfiguration \n\nresources: \n\n- resources: \n\n- secrets \n\n- configmaps \n\n- pandas.awesome.bears.example \n\n    providers: \n\n- aescbc: \n\n          keys: \n\n- name: key1 \n\n              secret: <base64 encoded key> \n\n- identity: {}\n```\n\nAfter you base64-encode it, add the key as the secret value. \n\n2. Save the configuration file to /etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml on the control plane node.  \n\nDon’t forget that your configuration file contains your key. Base64 encoding adds no security, so restrict permissions over the file as much as possible. \n\n3. Edit the manifest for the kube-apiserver static pod (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml) to contain the following command: *\\--encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml*. [Read more on the Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#write-an-encryption-configuration-file) website to see how to do this. \n\nAfter this, restart your API server to apply changes. After ensuring that all secrets are encrypted, remove the last line of the config file; “identity” allows for plaintext retrieval of secrets. \n\n### Key rotation \n\nKey management is just as important as the process of performing cryptographic operations. It doesn’t matter that your data is encrypted with the best encryption algorithm out there; if your key is leaked or stolen, an attacker can immediately decrypt your secret. So make sure to rotate your keys regularly to prevent data breaches. Let’s see how key rotation is handled in Kubernetes managed services and in self-managed clusters. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nIf you followed the previous steps and enabled EKS secret encryption with a KMS key, rotation is very easy to setup. Navigate to the KMS service, and under **Customer managed keys**, select the key you used. Under **Key rotation**, check the checkbox and click Save. The key will now be automatically rotated every eyar. \n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo rotate the key in a key vault, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <newKeyID>\n```\n\nRun the following command to re-encrypt secrets with the new key. \n\n```html\nkubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -\n```\n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to create a key, Cloud KMS sets the rotation period and next rotation time automatically. You can choose to use the default values or specify different values. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\nThese are the steps to rotate your decryption key, according to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/): \n\n1. Generate a new key securely and add it as the second entry for the current provider on all control plane nodes. Restart all kube-apiserver processes so that each server can decrypt data encrypted with the new key. \n2. Backup the new encryption key. If you lose it, you lose access to all data encrypted with it.  \n3. Make the new key the first entry in the keys array and restart all kube-apiserver processes. \n4. Run *kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -* to encrypt all secrets with the new key. \n5. Remove the old key from the configuration. \n\n### RBAC and the Least Privilege Principle \n\nNow that we’ve taken care of at-rest encryption, let’s see how to assign permissions to users securely.  \n\nTo manage permissions for secrets and for other Kubernetes objects, we recommend using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). RBAC allows you to assign fine-grained permissions with which users or groups of users can perform certain operations (such as create, read, update, or delete) on Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, services, etc. \n\n**Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings**  \n\nRoles and ClusterRoles are two kinds of Kubernetes objects that describe the permissions users are given if they have that role. The basic Role sets the permissions over an object or a set of objects within a specific namespace, while the ClusterRole spans across all namespaces of the cluster. Below, you can see an example of a Role: \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: Role \n\nmetadata: \n\n  namespace: default \n\n  name: pod-reader \n\nrules: \n\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]  \n\n  resources: [\"pods\"] \n\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] \n```\n\nA ClusterRole would simply have “kind: ClusterRole”, and no namespace specified. \n\nNotice how this is a role definition and not a policy; it’s not assigned to any user or group of users. Here come into play RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings. These objects form the relation between a role and a user or a group of users. RoleBindings grants the permissions defined in the Role object, and ClusterRoleBindings binds ClusterRoles to users or groups across the entire Kubernetes cluster. \n\nYou can also reference a ClusterRole in a RoleBinding! This way lets you define a set of common rules across your entire cluster, ensuring consistency across namespaces. Be careful though to not grant users more permissions than necessary by using the ClusterRole. \n\n[This is an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#restrictions-on-role-creation-or-update) of a ClusterRole, assigned to the user “dave” in the “development” namespace using a RoleBinding. \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: RoleBinding \n\nmetadata: \n\n  name: read-secrets \n\n  namespace: development \n\nsubjects: \n\n- kind: User \n\n  name: dave  \n\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io \n\nroleRef: \n\n  kind: ClusterRole \n\n  name: secret-reader \n\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\nAlways remember to assign the minimum permissions necessary. This minimizes the attack surface and prevents privilege escalation in case one of your pods or users is compromised. To follow the Least Privilege Principle and protect your secrets, keep in mind the following best practices for Kubernetes: \n\n* Assign only the specific permissions you want a user to have. Instead of using wildcard (*) permissions, which may result in overly privileged roles, specify the verbs of the actions they’re allowed to perform, \n* Assign roles at the namespace-level rather than at cluster-level, to give users privileges only for the namespaces they use, \n* Perform regular access reviews to ensure everything is functioning correctly and users are not accessing resources they shouldn’t, \n* Monitor your Kubernetes cluster constantly to identify suspicious behaviour. \n\n### **Centralized Secrets Store providers** \n\nBy using a cloud Secrets Store solution, you can centralize secrets management and leave the storage, auditing, logging to the cloud provider. Moreover, if you integrate your Kubernetes cluster within the cloud using a managed solution (like EKS, AKS, GKE), you obtain a unified infrastructure. \n\nTo understand how much better Secrets Stores are, let’s look at the available solutions on the market.  \n\n**AWS Secrets Manager** is a centralized and secure solution for storing, managing, and rotating secrets. It offers fine-grained access control using AWS IAM, automatic rotation of secrets, secure storage, and monitoring capabilities. It is integrated with Kubernetes, allowing you to access secrets at runtime. AWS Secrets Manager keeps secrets encrypted at rest and sends them securely over SSL. \n\nBy using a managed solution, the pressure on developers decreases, allowing them to focus on their tasks. \n\n**Azure Key Vault** is a Secrets Store for secrets, cryptographic keys and certificates. It has advanced safety and recovery options, two permission models, and data plane and control plane separation. You can read more about Azure Key Vault [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/). Azure Key Vault integrates seamlessly with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure services. \n\n**Google Cloud Secret Manager** is Google Cloud’s version for storing secrets securely. Google Cloud Secret Manager offers a fully managed solution for storing and managing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. It provides versioning, access controls, and audit logging capabilities, ensuring the secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information. \n\nUsing the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) for Kubernetes secrets, Secrets stored in managed stores in the cloud can be treated as files mounted in Kubernetes pods, allowing for a seamless utilization of secrets with no added complexity but with maximum security. \n\nManaging secrets in Kubernetes is a critical aspect of securing your Kubernetes cluster. In this article, we’ve discussed secrets encryption at rest, RBAC, and managed Secrets Store solutions in the cloud. \n\nImplementing a comprehensive secrets management strategy is a difficult task, but one that you should not work on alone. Cyscale can detect if your Kubernetes secrets are at risk and provide remediation for any findings in no time.  \n\n[Book a demo](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) now to see actionable insights and make use of hundreds of our security controls that constantly assess your environment, such as the following for Kubernetes: \n\n* Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles \n* Minimize access to secrets \n* Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables  \n\nMoreover, you can check out CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and CIS EKS Benchmark in our platform to see how secure your Kubernetes clusters are against attackers, with CIS AKS and CIS GKE Benchmarks arriving soon! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Cloud Security"],"title":"SMEs Face Security Pressure with Too Many Tools, Not Enough Skills","seoTitle":"SMEs face security pressure with too many tools, not enough skills","description":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","seoDescription":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","date":"2024-02-29T13:31:28.294Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"sme-security-pressure-too-many-tools-not-enough-skills","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/sme-security-pressure.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png","srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/ac644/sme-security-pressure.png 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/89b47/sme-security-pressure.png 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/913d0/sme-security-pressure.webp 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/91660/sme-security-pressure.webp 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/888e2/sme-security-pressure.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Security concerns are on the rise as the greatest challenge for IT admins at SMEs in Q1 2024, with 56% revealing that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture today than they were in April 2023.  \n\nAccording to [JumpCloud’s Q1 2024 SME IT Trends report](https://jumpcloud.com/resources/q1-2024-it-trends-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes), which surveyed IT stakeholders in UK, US, and India, the implication is that SMEs could be more vulnerable to cyber-attack than other segments. The report highlighted concerns over security amid a shortage of specialist skills and additional pressure on IT teams around compliance, with over two-thirds (75%) saying that more compliance and regulation requirements have been mandated in their region. \n\nThese concerns are backed up by long term trends in compliance. The International Organization for Standardization, which maintains the framework for ISO27001, said in its most recent report that certifications for ISO27001 increased 51% between 2020 to 2022 as more companies bowed to pressure from their own customers to prove security hardening and compliance.  \n\n## AI adoption is adding fuel to the fire \n\nWhile AI is seen by some as a cost-effective way of plugging the skills gap left by sweeping layoffs and a general lack of experienced professionals in specific sectors (such as security and cloud), IT admins tasked with integrating AI appear less confident, JumpCloud found.  \n\nDespite a mostly positive attitude toward AI in their organization, admins also report significant unease around AI’s impact on organizational security, with nearly two-thirds (62%) agreeing that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall. \n\n## Too many tools to be effective\n\nAnother challenge, compounded by a lack of manpower to carry out tasks, is that IT admins find themselves juggling too many tools to do their job.  \n\nThe vast majority (75%) of global respondents continue to prefer a single tool for a specific job rather than several-point solutions, roughly the same as the 77% who said the same in April 2023.  \n\n## MSPs come out on top \n\nBut this is all good news for Managed Service Providers, which continue to be a go-to resource for organizations under pressure.  \n\nNearly 76% rely on an MSP for at least some features and the trend is that organizations are leaning on MSPs for increased responsibilities, where SMEs are lacking the skills or the tools, or the ability to use the tools effectively.  \n\nThe survey found that an MSP completely manages the IT environment for 42% of respondents in UK, US, and India, versus 27% in April 2023—a 56% increase over 12 months. \n\nTellingly, security is the most common function for which organizations use MSPs (57% in 2024 versus 53% in April 2023), and the most popular reason why is that SMEs believe MSPs are up to date on the latest technologies (65%, up from 61% in April 2023), suggesting that smaller organizations are plugging the skills gap for complex subjects like security, cloud, and AI, with outsourcing.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Unlock New Revenue Streams With<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale Cloud Security for MSPs</span> \n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div> \n\n## Aggregation of tools and automation as the solution \n\nThese trends that JumpCloud has highlighted in the SME sector align closely with what we are hearing from the market and our own SME customer base.\n\nWhen it comes to cloud security specifically, IT admins and security professionals are struggling with multiple point solution tools that only apply to a single ecosystem. The cloud provider security tools only work for their own cloud, and skills for managing and securing that cloud are not transferable to another cloud either. This leaves SMEs struggling to meet security and compliance requirements and potentially losing business as a result.  \n\nSo, it comes as no surprise to see MSPs as the winners here. When small and medium businesses cannot get the skills in-house, but are seeing growing compliance pressures, they have no choice but to outsource the problem. What’s interesting is that MSPs and MSSPs face the same challenge, because the skills shortage is industry wide. But we work with a large number of managed service providers to help them unify their cloud security tools into a single platform and use automation to augment the security skills of their analysts to be transferable across all clouds and containerized environments. This means they can serve more customers with the same resources.\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Unifies Multiple<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cloud Security</span> Tools\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","seoTitle":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","description":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","seoDescription":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","date":"2024-02-27T14:48:18.017Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"container-escaping-leaky-vessels-docker-vulnerability","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/41be8/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/c78f7/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/913d0/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/91660/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/888e2/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"New vulnerabilities revealed in the runc command line tool could be exploited to allow attackers to escape containers and potentially get unauthorized access to the host operating system and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.  \n\n## What are the Leaky Vessels vulnerabilities? \n\nOn the 31st of January 2024, Snyk revealed four Docker container vulnerabilities with a critical security score ranging between 8.6 and 10. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).
