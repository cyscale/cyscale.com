This means that **financial companies have less than 2 years left to become compliant with DORA** and successfully manage operational risk. \n\nThe usage of cloud computing is witnessing a steady rise in 2023, and the financial sector is embracing this trend with open arms. \n\nTo understand DORA and its implication for cloud infrastructures in financial companies, let's look at the requirements and how an organization can become compliant with it. \n\n## Structure \n\nDORA has nine chapters that include general provisions, ICT risk management, digital operational resilience testing, and others.  \n\nThe chapter that contains technical requirements that apply to cloud environments is the second one, **ICT risk management**. In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* \n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA. Kickstart your compliance journey with us now and ensure a smooth process for DORA compliance. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"What’s new: Major updates for Cyscale Automated Cloud Security Platform","seoTitle":"What’s new: Major updates for Cyscale Automated Cloud Security Platform","description":"In the newest major update, Cyscale has added to the Cloud Security Platform scopes, asset security score, enhanced graphs, improved alerts, integration with AWS inspector, more controls, improved compliance reports, and many others.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given best practices. \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in cloud security and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with the challenges of securing cloud resources.

Dive into this guide as we explore the foundations and best practices of [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/). \n\n## The Basics of Cloud Compliance \n\n### What is Cloud Compliance? \n\nCloud compliance refers to the standards and laws set by regulation bodies to ensure data stored on the cloud remains safe, private, and within the boundaries of set cybersecurity rules. These rules often pertain to industries handling sensitive data, like healthcare (with HIPAA requirements) or e-commerce (following PCI DSS guidelines). \n\n### Key Regulations and Standards \n\n* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: This standard is focused around safeguarding credit card transactions. It regulates how cardholder data is stored and transmitted. \n* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: HIPAA is a United States healthcare law that refers to patient data and how it should be stored and used by companies. Moreover, this law covers how companies should act if patient PII is leaked. \n* **SOC 2**: Evaluates a company's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. \n* **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: Provides standards and guidelines for federal agencies to architect and secure their information systems. There are three frameworks that can be used when establishing compliance with the [NIST standard](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/): NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53, and NIST 800-171. \n* **ISO 27001**: This standard ensures that the organization has an effective and secure information security management. \n* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: GDPR is the most well-known and important European regulation protecting personal data. \n\n## Shared Responsibility Model \n\nThe shared responsibility model is a concept that defines how security responsibilities are divided between the cloud service provider (CSP), and the cloud user. This model outlines which party is responsible of each component of a cloud environment. For example, the cloud service provider is responsible of the physical security of the cloud computing infrastructure, while the customer takes care of their apps, data, and workloads. \n\nThe most popular cloud service providers are: \n\n1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\n2. Google Cloud \n\n3. Microsoft Azure \n\nAll major providers have, and regularly renew, their certificates of compliance with regulations. However, the weight of these regular updates also falls on the users’ shoulders: they still have the responsibility of getting certified to prove that the way they make use of cloud services (for apps, data, and workloads) matches the standard requirement. \n\n## Best Practices for Cloud Compliance \n\n### 1. Regular Audits \n\nRoutine checks are critical to identify potential vulnerabilities. Utilize tools like [cloud misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) to improve your cloud's security posture. \n\n### 2. Automation in Compliance \n\nBy integrating automation in compliance processes, you can help your company streamline future audits and achieve compliance easier. The Cyscale Cloud Platform removes a lot of the manual work that’s usually involved in preparing for and gathering evidence for an audit, offering support for popular standards such as [PCI DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/) or [ISO27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/). \n\n### 3. Education and Training \n\nThe realm of cloud security and compliance is ever-evolving. Continuous learning ensures your organization adheres to best practices, especially concerning cybersecurity. Moreover, conducting training for all employees of your company to help them understand how current prevalent attacks such as phishing work and how to protect themselves from them is a necessary step to protecting your organization. \n\n### 4. Data Management and Security \n\nGuard your sensitive data, with special attention for multi-cloud environments. While data security is vital in any computing environment, multi-cloud environments introduce additional complexities that require a heightened level of vigilance. Embrace encryption, multi-factor authentication, and API-level security. \n\n## Navigating Challenges \n\n### 1. Common Challenges in Cloud Compliance\n\nTo be able to address challenges in cloud compliance, you need to understand what some of the most common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are: \n\n* Poor access control, \n* Insufficient logging and monitoring, \n* Lack of encryption or the use of inadequate cryptographic algorithms, \n* Weak authentication, and others. \n\n### 2. Case Studies \n\nDive into scenarios where businesses faced cloud security challenges and understand the strategies they employed. Two examples of situations Cyscale has been helping companies with are: \n\n* [Lack of contextual visibility](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/) in a complex cloud environment \n* [A time-consuming compliance process](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech/) \n\n## How can Cyscale help? \n\nOffering unparalleled contextual visibility across cloud and data repositories, Cyscale grants organizations the power to scrutinize everything from resource-level configurations to their holistic compliance posture.
