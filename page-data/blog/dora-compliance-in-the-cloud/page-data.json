This means that **financial companies have less than 2 years left to become compliant with DORA** and successfully manage operational risk. \n\nThe usage of cloud computing is witnessing a steady rise in 2023, and the financial sector is embracing this trend with open arms. \n\nTo understand DORA and its implication for cloud infrastructures in financial companies, let's look at the requirements and how an organization can become compliant with it. \n\n## Structure \n\nDORA has nine chapters that include general provisions, ICT risk management, digital operational resilience testing, and others.  \n\nThe chapter that contains technical requirements that apply to cloud environments is the second one, **ICT risk management**. In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* \n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\n \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA.

ECS enables users to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.  \n\nIn this article, we will explore:  \n\n* what ECS is,  \n* how it works,  \n* common vulnerabilities, and most importantly,  \n* container security best practices to maximize cybersecurity on the ECS platform. \n\n## Understanding Amazon ECS \n\nAmazon ECS is a container orchestration service that simplifies the deployment and management of containers on AWS. It allows you to run containers at scale without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nECS provides the flexibility to choose between two launch types: EC2 and Fargate. With the EC2 launch type, containers are run on EC2 instances that you have to manage, while with Fargate, AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you only focus on deploying and scaling containers. \n\n## What is Amazon ECS used for? \n\nECS is a service suitable for a wide range of use cases, such as \n\n* **microservices architecture**: ECS enables you to break down your application into smaller, independently deployable microservices, facilitating scalability and flexibility. \n* **batch processing**: ECS simplifies the execution of batch workloads by running containers in parallel, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing processing time. \n* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: With ECS, you can build an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying containerized applications, ensuring faster and efficient software delivery. \n* **web applications**: ECS is ideal for hosting web apps, providing automatic scaling capabilities, load balancing, and seamless integration with other AWS services. \n\n## Common Vulnerabilities \n\nWhile ECS provides a robust container management framework, it's crucial to be aware of common vulnerabilities that can impact containerized apps: \n\n* **Inadequate IAM permissions**: Misconfigured AWS IAM roles and policies can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within ECS. \n* **Vulnerable container images**: Using outdated or insecure container images that contain known security vulnerabilities can expose applications to exploitation and malware. \n* **Weak network security**: Misconfigured security groups, improper network isolation, or exposure of unnecessary ports are a few examples that can lead to unauthorized access to containers or sensitive data. \n* **Lack of logging and monitoring**: Insufficient monitoring and logging of ECS services can make detecting and responding to security incidents challenging. \n\n## Best practices for containers security on ECS \n\nSecure your production environments and improve your cloud security posture by following the best practices described in this article. \n\n### 1. Implement IAM best practices\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege by assigning granular IAM roles to ECS tasks and services. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and follow AWS security best practices. Enforce strong password rules to ensure secure authentication. \n\n### 2. Secure container images \n\nUtilize secure container base images from trusted sources. Perform regular image scanning for new vulnerabilities and update container images. Leverage Dockerfile best practices to create secure and efficient Docker container images. \n\n### 3. Configure network security \n\nLeverage security groups and network ACLs to enforce fine-grained network traffic access controls for ECS containers. Only expose necessary ports and protocols, and use encryption for data in transit. Implement network segmentation by allowing connectivity only between the containers that truly need it and isolating the rest. Utilize Kubernetes network security policies to control the traffic between containers. Avoid using public IP addresses for ECS instances to prevent unintended access to your app servers. \n\n### 4. Enable logging and monitoring\n\nEnable detailed logging for ECS services and applications. Utilize AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize logs for monitoring and analysis and turn on Container Insights for your ECS clusters. Continuous monitoring can help you identify security issues at container runtime. \n\n### 5. Manage dependencies and vulnerabilities \n\nRegularly update and patch the host operating system and other software dependencies used within your container images. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in your containerized applications. If you’re using Fargate, ensure the services are running on the latest Fargate platform version; new updates come with security patches and bug fixes.  \n\n### 6. Do not run containers as the root user \n\nRunning containers with high privileges can increase the attack surface by allowing attackers to take advantage of this misconfiguration and “escape” the containers, obtaining high privileges on the host virtual machine. This breaks the isolation of containers. Run your ECS containers as non-privileged by setting the *privileged* parameter in the container definition to *false*. \n\n  \n\nMitigate security risks by implementing the recommended best practices and secure your container environment. \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale provides a Containers dashboard, where you can see what assets are using them and other details about containers, as well as controls that check for ECS misconfigurations and provide alerting and remediation steps to fix findings in no time.  \n\nSome examples of security controls that you can find on the Cyscale platform are: \n\n* *Ensure ECS services don't have public IP addresses assigned to them automatically*\n* *Ensure ECS clusters use Container Insights*\n* *Ensure ECS containers run as non-privileged*\n* *Ensure ECS containers are limited to read-only access to root filesystems*"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"Understanding Container Images: Common Vulnerabilities and Best Practices","seoTitle":"Understanding Container Images: Common Vulnerabilities and Best Practices","description":"Container images are files that contain everything needed to run software on containers: code, system tools, libraries, runtime tools.

Containers are a lightweight solution that allows applications to run independently of operating systems. Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies and provide numerous benefits, such as: \n\n* **Portability.** Because containers encapsulate everything needed to run applications, they can be moved between environments without causing the need for additional libraries or other tools. \n* **Consistency.** By including all the needed dependencies in a container image, an app will work the same across different machines; no more \"it works on my machine\". \n* **Scalability.** By leveraging container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, you can dynamically scale containers based on demand, allowing your application to handle varying workloads effectively. \n* **Isolation.** Since the app has its own environment, it is isolated from other resources. This adds a layer of security.  \n\n## Container images vulnerabilities \n\nContainers have many advantages. However, they can also introduce unique vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure. Let’s look at some of them to fully understand the impact of using containerization. \n\n### 1. Vulnerable libraries. \n\nContainer images often contain third-party libraries and dependencies. It is not uncommon for libraries to have known vulnerabilities.  \n\nRegularly scanning and updating these dependencies is critical to reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Insecure configurations \n\nMisconfigured container images can lead to the compromise of confidentiality of data, unauthorized access, and others. Examples of insecure settings include: \n\n* Weak access control, \n* The usage of environment variables to pass sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys), \n* Poor network settings, such as unnecessary open ports. \n\n### 3. Outdated software \n\nContainer images may contain outdated frameworks, operating systems, and libraries. If they are not regularly updated, they may have vulnerabilities. Run your applications on updated OSs and use newer versions of frameworks and libraries to ensure that your infrastructure is patched! \n\n## Common best practices \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of best practices that you should follow when using container images or when creating them: \n\n1. ### Ensure visibility in your cloud environment \n\nContainers are widely used in cloud environments due to their scalability and efficiency. To understand how container images affect your security posture, you need to gain visibility in your cloud infrastructure and grasp the context of every image in use by: \n\n* mapping cloud resources to the images they’re using, \n* identifying which of those assets have access to critical data, \n* assessing the container image configurations. \n\n2. ### Use trusted base images \n\nOnly utilize trusted images from known, reputable sources to ensure that the container images you're using are patched and have undergone security reviews. These images are not guaranteed to be completely secure, but it's a good starting point. \n\n3. ### Perform regular updates \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, patch container images to avoid the use of outdated or vulnerable frameworks, libraries or operating systems.  \n\n4. ### Scan your container images for vulnerabilities \n\nScan images regularly for known vulnerabilities and make sure to address any findings. Reduce the attack surface and obtain insights into vulnerabilities present in the software components of a container image. \n\n5. ### Harden your container image \n\nReduce the attack surface of your containerized applications: \n\n1. Implement [the least privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege): do not run processes as root to prevent the possibility of privilege escalation inside your container. \n2. Disable unnecessary services and functionalities: minimize potential entry points for attackers by disabling tools that are not required. \n3. Restrict ports accessibility: do not leave networks ports open unnecessarily. \n\n## Container images – where are they present? \n\nContainer images can be used in various cloud-based services across public cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.  \n\nThese services leverage container images to enable the seamless deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. \n\nExamples of services that run container images are: \n\n* ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service), EKS (Amazon Kubernetes Service) \n* AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), \n* GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), and others. \n\n\n\nContainers form the foundation of modern cloud-based application deployment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand their purpose, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices for securing them. By implementing the recommended best practices and staying informed about emerging threats, your organization can secure container environments and ensure the safety of cloud-based applications. \n\nIn the dynamic landscape of cloud security, continuous learning and adaptation are paramount. As containerization continues to revolutionize the cloud industry, maintaining a strong focus on container image security will help organizations stay ahead of potential threats and safeguard their valuable assets.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security.\n\n\n\nUpgrade your cloud security strategy with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), a powerful tool offering comprehensive cloud inventory, advanced risk detection, multi-cloud support, and streamlined compliance processes to strengthen your business's cloud security posture."}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
