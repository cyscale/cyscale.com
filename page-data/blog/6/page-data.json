This guide provides insights into best practices that are integral to this strategy.\n\nData security is one of the biggest concerns of cloud-based organizations. When you think about protecting data, you need to make sure you’re providing the following features:\n\n* Confidentiality,\n* Integrity,\n* Availability.\n\nMoreover, these three security principles need to be implemented for all three states of data, which are:\n\n* In motion,\n* In use,\n* At rest.\n\nThis mission may seem daunting. Let’s break it down and understand every step of the process of securing data. In this article, you will find out:\n\n* The type of attacks that threaten your data,\n* Cloud security best practices,\n* Security solutions on the market from cloud service providers,\n* How to identify any gaps in your security policies.\n\n## **How do you ensure confidentiality?**\n\nConfidentiality is a security principle that states that only authorized users should be able to access the data. It should not be visible to unauthorized entities.\n\n### **Encryption**\n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is the process of scrambling data to obtain unreadable ciphertext. The algorithm uses a key to encrypt it, and if you are not in possession of the decryption key, you cannot reverse it back to its original state.\n\nEncryption solutions for the three states of data are: \n\n* For in motion data: SSL/TLS. They are transport protocols that encrypt data in transit. \n* For in use data: memory encryption, called Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory. \n* [For at rest data:](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) industry-recommended symmetric algorithms such as AES-256 are used to perform full disk, database, file system, and cloud assets encryption and to safely store data. \n\nUsing these best practices, you can improve your cloud security posture and prevent data breaches or other security incidents.\n\n### **Access control** \n\nA layered approach should be used when securing data in the cloud. This is where a robust **[cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/)** becomes crucial. This means that encryption of data at rest should only be considered as the last measure of protection if access control rules are bypassed. \n\nYou must secure access to databases, buckets, and other storage assets by restricting it as much as possible. In doing this, you become compliant with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\nA few access control best practices for [database protection](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/) are:\n\n* Filter inbound and outbound traffic,\n* Secure your database connection,\n* Keep your connection details secret.\n\nFor [buckets that contain sensitive information](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/#storage-access), do not allow public read/write access and use access control lists to define granular rules.\n\nBesides access control, to ensure robust data protection, strong authentication mechanisms should be put in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a must-have security measure for cloud computing environments.\n\nBy implementing these IAM (Identity and Access Management) best practices, attack surface is reduced and your cloud infrastructure is secured.\n\n### **Data classification**\n\nClassifying data does not protect it on its own. However, this process can help you understand which is the most sensitive data in order to better focus your efforts to secure it.\n\nAWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, and Google Cloud provide labels or tags for users to implement [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/). Labels/tags can be predefined by the public cloud vendor or can be user-defined according to the user’s specific needs.\n\n## **How do you ensure integrity?**\n\nEnsuring integrity means that data must not be altered in transit or at rest. Integrity is usually accomplished using hashes and checksums.\n\nThey are computed before the data is used or transferred and then again after. If the two values of hashes/checksums match, then the data was not altered in transit or at rest. Otherwise, that data was tampered with.\n\nLet’s look at public cloud vendors and how they provide data integrity services:\n\n* AWS S3 uses CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256 to check the data integrity after uploading/downloading,\n* Google Cloud also uses CRC32C checksums to verify data integrity.\n\n## **How do you ensure availability?**\n\nData availability means that any user should be able at any point to access their data without disruptions.\n\nFor data in the public cloud, vendors provide solutions to replicate and backup it in different data centers and regions.\n\nWe need to look at **availability zones** to understand availability in the cloud.\n\nAvailability zones are groups of data centers in the same region containing replicated data. If a data center fails, the other data center in the availability zone takes the responsibility, providing fault tolerance and increased availability and preventing data loss.\n\nMoreover, public cloud vendors support region pairs. A region is paired with another region at a great distance (for example, at least 300km away for Azure). If a natural disaster, civil unrest, or any other unforeseen events occur, the secondary region becomes the main source of cloud service.\n\nAnother service available in the public cloud that helps ensure availability is **DDOS protection**.\n\nDDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an attack designed to crash an application or a service by sending substantial amounts of traffic to it.\n\nA few examples of available DDOS services to secure cloud infrastructure are:\n\n* AWS Shield,\n* Azure DDOS Protection,\n* Google Cloud Armor.\n\n**Implementing our recommendations**\n\nEnsuring [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) is not an easy task. There are many aspects to be considered, and a small mistake can leave a vulnerability in your cloud environment.\n\nCyscale provides powerful dashboards to ensure visibility of your assets, the identities in your cloud, and an overview of your data security.\n\nMoreover, 400+ security controls ensure that your security teams have implemented the cybersecurity principles and best practices. Here are some examples of controls that can be used to ensure data security:\n\n* **In motion data encryption**: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Microsoft Azure\n* **At rest data encryption**: *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer*-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) for Google Cloud\n* **Access control**: *Ensure S3 bucket policy does not grant Allow permission to everyone* for AWS\n* **Data classification**: *Ensure Kubernetes Clusters are configured with Labels* for Google Cloud\n* **DDOS Protection**: *Ensure Anti-DDoS access and security log service is enabled* for Alibaba Cloud\n\nBefore diving into specific controls, it's essential to acknowledge the evolving **[cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/)** that businesses face. With a constantly changing digital landscape, understanding these challenges can help shape your security strategies more effectively."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","seoTitle":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","description":"A database is one of the most important cloud assets.

It usually stores sensitive information that should be well protected.  \n\nWhen we’re discussing databases in the cloud, there are two options for users. They can: \n\n* manage their own database in the cloud, or \n* use a service provided by their cloud vendor. \n\nThe latter is usually the easier choice since the cloud vendor takes care of security features.  \n\nHowever, your database may be vulnerable in both cases if you don’t configure your environment correctly. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for securing databases in the cloud and how to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that may exist or appear in the future. \n\n## Best practices \n\n### 1. Filter inbound and outbound traffic. \n\nManaging traffic to and from the database is the first layer of database protection. Place databases behind firewalls and restrict the traffic allowed to reach them as much as possible. \n\nYou can implement more granular rules by only allowing a list of known IPs to connect to a database (for example, the range of addresses specific to a known data center), or by filtering traffic based on other criteria. \n\nMoreover, you can apply conditional access for users when administering the database. You can ask for additional security checks like Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure the entities managing the database are legitimate. \n\n### 2. Ensure availability through redundancy \n\nWhen deploying a database in the public cloud, you have the option to ensure availability through redundancy. You can replicate a database in different data centers and even different geographical regions. \n\nIf one data center or region fails, you can rely on a replication of the database located in a different data center to work. \n\n### 3. Encrypt your database \n\nDatabase [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) is important for protecting your data at rest.  \n\nEnsure that only authorized entities can see the data you’re storing in the database by [encrypting it ](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/)with a strong, recommended algorithm such as AES-256. Keep your encryption keys safe by storing them separately from the data, use strong generation algorithms and rotate them every 90 days or less. \n\n### 4. Secure your database connection \n\nNot only data at rest is vulnerable. When you're transferring data to and from the database, it is essential to encrypt your traffic.  \n\nThis is called encryption for data in transit and is implemented with the TLS/SSL protocols. \n\n### 5. Keep your connection details secret \n\nDo not disclose database connection strings, keys, certificates, and other secrets that may be used to breach your database. You can use cloud solutions to keep your cryptographic secrets safe: \n\n* [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) Key Vault, \n* [AWS ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/)Key Management Service (AWS KMS), \n* [Google Cloud ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/)Secret Manager, \n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), and others. \n\n### 6. Log connection attempts \n\nKeep track of who is trying to connect to your database by logging any authentication attempts. In this way, you can see if: \n\n* someone unauthorized is trying to or is connecting to the database, \n* there is a brute-force attack taking place.  \n\n### 7. Perform regular database backups \n\nDatabases should be backed up regularly, to prevent loss of data, in the case of: \n\n* Data corruption, and \n* Ransomware attacks. \n\nAlthough ransomware attacks are less common in cloud environments at the moment, attackers could in time develop the proper tactics. \n\n![RPO and RTO](/img/20_blog-rpo-and-rto.webp#shadow \"RPO and RTO\")\n\nThe time between the backups is known as RPO (Recovery Point Objective). It is measured as the time that passed between the last backup and the current one. If a disaster appears, the data written in that time is lost. \n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the time it takes for an application to go back online after a disaster and to restore its data.   \n\nRTO and RPO should be kept in acceptable limits. \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to ensure you’re implementing all the best practices we mentioned in this article. [Cyscale ](https://cyscale.com/)has over 400 controls that can help you secure your entire cloud environment. \n\nHere are some examples of controls that check for any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities regarding your database setup in the public cloud: \n\n* *Ensure encrypted storage is used for VMs that might host a database* for AWS \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances require all incoming connections to use SSL* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database* for Alibaba Cloud \n\nAlong with these controls that alert you on any findings, you receive remediation steps to quickly eliminate any vulnerabilities and secure your database in the cloud. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Protecting Data at Rest Using Encryption  ","seoTitle":"Protecting Data at Rest Using Encryption  ","description":"Data at rest is data that is not currently used or transmitted between computer systems.

Data at rest can be stored in: \n\n* Storage cloud assets such as buckets, \n* Databases, \n* Files, and others. \n\nThe most common method of protecting data at rest is through [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this article, we will look at ways to perform encryption and understand its importance. \n\n## Why is it important to encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are three main risks regarding data at rest: \n\n* loss,  \n* leakage,  \n* theft. \n\nIn all three cases, your data at rest will probably end up in somebody’s hands. You can forget your USB drive in a coffee shop, you can accidentally disclose your data to someone else or the public or it can be stolen by a malicious attacker. \n\nFor these reasons, a safeguarding mechanism is encrypting your data. \n\nWith this method, even if someone else gets ahold of your data, they will not be able to read it. \n\n## Client-side and server-side encryption \n\nClient-side encryption is done on a local device with the user's key. \n\nServer-side encryption is implemented in the cloud, and the cloud vendor usually takes care of the key. This method of encryption is easier to use, since the cloud provider takes care of the algorithm, the key management system, and other troubles you may have. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for client-side encryption, as well as solutions offered for server-side encryption.  \n\n## How do you encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are a few best practices that need to be considered when undergoing the encryption process: \n\n### 1. Use an industry-recommended standard with an appropriate key length. \n\nFor data at rest, symmetric encryption algorithms are usually used. An industry-recommended standard is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 2. Classify data and decide what to encrypt. \n\nMake sure you don’t leave any sensitive data unencrypted. Use [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) to decide what data should be encrypted.  \n\nAlternatively, perform full disk encryption to protect all data, especially in case you lose the hardware. \n\n## Key management \n\nNow that we’ve established how to encrypt data at rest, let’s talk keys.  \n\nIf your key management is poor, no matter how strong and well-done an encryption is, it can become totally useless. \n\nFollow the best practices we’re recommending to ensure textbook key management.  \n\n### 1. Use a random key generation algorithm for your keys.  \n\nMost random number generator algorithms are not truly random; they are called Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs).  \n\nIf you’re using programmatic functions such as random() or rand() from C++, Java, and other languages, you’re not generating random keys; they use a seed (which always gives the same result), can be predicted, and are not for cryptographic usage. \n\nFor this reason, you need to use tools that utilize Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs). \n\nTo generate a random, secure key, you can use: \n\n* [GenerateRandom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html), a tool provided by AWS, \n* the [GenerateRandomBytes](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/generate-random) API from Google Cloud, \n* [SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html), a class from Java, and others. \n\n### 2. Store your keys separately from your ciphertext. \n\nDo not store your keys in the same place as encrypted data, and do not hardcode them in the source code. You can use: \n\n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware security modules (HSM), \n* key management systems such as Azure Key Vault and AWS KMS, \n* open source KMS such as HashiCorp Vault. \n\n### 3. Rotate the keys. \n\nChange the keys regularly (every 90 days or less). This process involves retiring an encryption key and generating a new one. \n\nMoreover, if a key is compromised, immediately replace it and assess which data is at risk. \n\n### 4. Implement access control for keys \n\nEnsure that access to keys is heavily restricted in the following ways: \n\n* [Implement the Least Privilege Principle.](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) Only the individuals that need the keys should be able to access them. You can also implement time windows when keys can be accessed. \n* Only authorized personnel should be able to access keys. Ensure that, after you’ve granted access rights to people, only they can see and use the keys. \n\n###  5. Manage key deletion \n\nIf a key is permanently deleted, all data encrypted with that key is lost. The key should be appropriately destroyed after all the encrypted data is decrypted and re-encrypted with a new key. \n\nSolutions from cloud vendors for safe key deletion are: \n\n* Soft delete in Azure Key Vault, \n* Key deletion scheduling in AWS. \n\n## Server-side encryption - cloud solutions \n\nAWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide data at rest encryption and key management solutions. Let's look at the available options and how to make sure you're using them correctly. \n\n### Encryption in AWS \n\nThe following services in AWS support data at rest encryption capabilities: \n\n* Amazon EBS, \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift, \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nKey management is done using the AWS Key Management Service, which allows users to utilize their own keys or let AWS deal with them. \n\n### Encryption in Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, users have the following options: \n\n* Azure Disk Encryption, for Virtual Machines, \n* Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database, which encrypt all data at rest. \n\nFor key management, Azure provides the following services: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM). \n\n### Encryption in Google Cloud \n\nFor key management, Google Cloud provides the Google Key Management Service. As an additional layer of security, the encryption key, named DEK (Data Encryption Key), is also encrypted using a KEK (Key-encryption key).  \n\n## How do you check for encryption misconfigurations? \n\nAs we’ve seen, there are many best practices to be considered, and therefore there is room for mistakes. \n\nYou can quickly [check for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) regarding data at rest encryption in the cloud using Cyscale’s controls. Here are a few examples of controls that check if you’re implementing the best practices described in this article: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure storage for critical data are encrypted with Customer Managed Key* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure EBS encryption by default is enabled* for AWS, \n* *Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest* for AWS. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Product"],"title":"How to Check for Least Privilege with Cyscale’s New Identity Dashboard ","seoTitle":"How to Check for Least Privilege with Cyscale’s New Identity Dashboard ","description":"The Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions and for more time than they require for their day-to-day tasks.

It is essential to know which entities have left to ensure you have a complete offboarding process and that they no longer have permissions. \n\nIf we expand a card of an identity that no longer exists in the company, we see that their account is disabled because it is greyed out. \n\n![Disabled identity](/img/blog_18-2-disabled-identity.webp#shadow \"Disabled identity\")\n\nTo understand an identity's impact on the entire organization's environment, you must have comprehensive visibility.  \n\nThe following image shows that the analyzed user has accounts in Alibaba, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Okta. Furthermore, we can see that they are part of the \"**Admins**\" group, as well as others, and as a result, are \"**Highly Privileged**”. \n\n![Highly privileged identity](/img/blog_18-3-andrei-stefanie.webp#shadow \"Highly privileged identity\")\n\nIf we expand each account’s card, we can see the environment they have access to. Besides tracking permissions, it is crucial to also track the actual environments each user has access to. In the cloud, this tends to quickly become hard to track because applications often span multiple accounts. \n\n<br/>\n\nBeing highly privileged is not necessarily an issue, however, combining it with the lack of MFA does become a problem. Cyscale highlights this situation. This can be seen immediately after expanding a person’s card, so the vulnerability is not missed. \n\nIn this example, the user’s Okta account does not have MFA. [Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) where you can onboard your accounts, which helps you manage your organization’s access to other applications through SSO. \n\nIn the image below, you can see the accounts assigned using Okta. Therefore, if there is a vulnerability in your Okta account, all those accounts may be compromised. \n\n![Okta identity](/img/blog_18-4-okta.webp#shadow \"Okta identity\")\n\nAnother useful feature of the Identity Dashboard is the “Alerts” section. If an account has security alerts, the user can click on them and be redirected to the Alerts page. There, you can see failed controls along with: \n\n* Severity, \n* The asset involved, \n* The status, and others. \n\nYou can immediately pinpoint any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using these alerts and quickly solve them with the remediation steps provided. \n\nBesides visibility, Cyscale provides controls that automatically check for misconfigurations. \n\nThere are over 400 controls currently available in Cyscale. A few examples of controls that verify you’re implementing the Least Privilege Principle correctly are: \n\n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n* *Ensure that ServiceAccount has no Admin privileges* for Google Cloud Platform \n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Ensure IAM Users that are inactive for 30 days or more are deactivated* for AWS \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","seoTitle":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","description":"Encryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality.

Entities that do not have the decryption key in their possession cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, read its content. \n\n## How does encryption work? \n\nPlaintext data is transformed, using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, to ciphertext, which is unreadable text.  \n\nThere are two types of encryption algorithms: \n\n* Symmetric,  \n* Asymmetric. \n\nIn symmetric algorithms, the key used to perform the encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt it and is, therefore, secret. \n\nExamples of symmetric algorithms are: \n\n* DES (Data Encryption Standard),  \n* 3DES (Triple DES), \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). \n\nThe latter one is, in 2022, the industry standard and is recommended to be used with 128 bits keys. \n\n![Symmetric encryption](/img/blog_17-cisco_encryption.webp#shadow \"Symmetric encryption\")\n\nImage source – cisco.com \n\nAsymmetric algorithms use two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. \n\nAsymmetric algorithm examples are: \n\n* RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), \n* ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). \n\nAsymmetric algorithms are not commonly used for encryption because they are slower. For example, the RSA algorithm requires keys between 1024 and 4096 bits, which slows down the encryption and decryption process.  \n\nThese algorithms can be used, however, to encrypt symmetric algorithm keys when they are distributed. \n\nA more common usage of asymmetric algorithms is digital signatures. They are mathematical algorithms that are used to cryptographically validate the authenticity and integrity of a message or media on the internet. \n\n## What is encryption used for? \n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality of data. The unreadable ciphertext keeps the data private from all parties that do not possess the decryption key. \n\nData has three states: \n\n* In motion, \n* In use, \n* At rest. \n\nIt is essential to understand these states and ensure that the data is always encrypted. It is not enough to encrypt data only when it is stored if, when in transit, a malicious party can still read it.  \n\nTherefore, we will look at encryption mechanisms for all three data states. \n\n### In Motion Encryption \n\nData in motion, or in transit, is data that is moved from one location to another, for example, between: \n\n* computers,  \n* services,  \n* virtual machines,  \n* applications, \n* networks.  \n\nExamples of data in motion are: \n\n* emails, \n* files, \n* messages. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nSSL/TLS ensure confidentiality through encryption. Firstly, a session is created between the two parties exchanging a message using asymmetric encryption. Then, after the secure session is established, symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt the data in motion. \n\nUsing one of the mentioned protocols prevents attackers from reading the data in motion. \n\nWebsites should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP to ensure encryption between websites and browsers. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS. \n\n**What is in motion data vulnerable to?** \n\n**Eavesdropping attacks.** In this situation, malicious entities can analyze traffic sent over the internet and read unencrypted data.   \n\n### In Use Encryption \n\nData currently accessed and used is considered in use.   \n\nExamples of in use data are: \n\n* files that are currently open, \n* databases, \n* RAM data. \n\nBecause data needs to be decrypted to become in use, it is essential that data security is taken care of before the actual use of data begins. \n\nTo do this, you need to ensure a good authentication mechanism. Technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be implemented to increase security. \n\nMoreover, after a user authenticates, access management is necessary. Users should not be allowed to access any available resources, only the ones they need to, in order to perform their job.  \n\nA method of encryption for data in use is Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory using an AES-128 encryption engine and an [AMD EPYC processor](https://developer.amd.com/sev/). Other hardware vendors are also offering memory encryption for data in use, but this area is still relatively new. \n\n**What is in use data vulnerable to?**  \n\nIn use data is vulnerable to **authentication attacks**. These types of attacks are used to gain access to the data by bypassing authentication, brute-forcing or obtaining credentials, and others. \n\nAnother type of attack for data in use is a **cold boot attack**. Even though the RAM memory is considered volatile, after a computer is turned off, it takes a few minutes for that memory to be erased. If kept at low temperatures, RAM memory can be extracted, and, therefore, the last data loaded in the RAM memory can be read. \n\n### At Rest Encryption \n\nOnce data arrives at the destination and is not used, it becomes at rest.  \n\nExamples of data at rest are: \n\n* databases, \n* cloud storage assets such as buckets, \n* files and file archives, \n* USB drives, and others. \n\nThis data state is usually most targeted by attackers who attempt to read databases, steal files stored on the computer, obtain USB drives, and others. \n\nEncryption of data at rest is fairly simple and is usually done using symmetric algorithms. When you perform at rest data encryption, you need to ensure you’re following these best practices: \n\n* you're using an industry-standard algorithm such as AES, \n* you’re using the recommended key size, \n* you’re managing your cryptographic keys properly by not storing your key in the same place and changing it regularly, \n* the key-generating algorithms used to obtain the new key each time are random enough. \n\nFor the examples of data given above, you can have the following encryption schemes: \n\n* full disk encryption, \n* database encryption, \n* file system encryption, \n* cloud assets encryption. \n\nOne important aspect of encryption is cryptographic keys management. You must store your keys safely to ensure confidentiality of your data. \n\nYou can store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM), which are dedicated hardware devices for key management. They are hardened against malware or other types of attacks. \n\nAnother secure solution is storing keys in the cloud, using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\n**What is at rest data vulnerable to?** \n\nAlthough data at rest is the easiest to secure out of all three states, it is usually the point of focus for attackers. There are a few types of attacks data in transit is vulnerable to: \n\n* **Exfiltration attacks.** The most common way at rest data is compromised is through exfiltration attacks, which means that hackers try to steal that data. For this reason, implementing a very robust encryption scheme is important.  <br>Another essential thing to note is that, when data is exfiltrated, even if it is encrypted, attackers can try to brute-force cryptographic keys offline for a long period of time. Therefore a long, random encryption key should be used (and rotated regularly). \n* **Hardware attacks.** If a person loses their laptop, phone, or USB drive and the data stored on them is not encrypted (and the devices are not protected by passwords or have weak passwords), the individual who found the device can read its contents. \n\n## Are you protecting data in all states? \n\nUse Cyscale to ensure that you’re protecting data by taking advantage of over 400 controls. \n\nHere are just a few examples of controls that ensure data security through encryption across different cloud vendors: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure server-side encryption is set to 'Encrypt with Service Key'* for Alibaba \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"SOC 2 Compliance in The Cloud","seoTitle":"SOC 2 Compliance in The Cloud","description":"SOC 2 is an international compliance standard that defines rules for B2B (business-to-business) organizations regarding data security.

Security \n2. Availability \n3. Processing Integrity \n4. Confidentiality \n5. Privacy \n\n## SOC 2 requirements, explained for cloud \n\nIn order to become [SOC 2 compliant](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/), you must fulfill 64 trust service criteria across the 5 TSCs mentioned above.. Based on them, the organization establishes corresponding controls to demonstrate compliance. \n\nIn this section, we will look at some of the points of focus necessary to obtain the accreditation. They should be taken into account by companies that use cloud services.  \n\nGrouped by criteria and explained, here are examples of requirements: \n\n#### 1. Security \n\n* Implements Boundary Protection Systems - The company uses firewalls, IDSs, DMZs to secure devices. \n* Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials - [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is configured for all users. \n\n#### 2. Availability \n\n* Designs Detection Measures - Logging and monitoring are implemented. \n* Implements Alerts to Analyze Anomalies – Targeted alerts are used to ensure fast remediation for high-priority assets. \n\n#### 3. Processing Integrity \n\n* Protects Stored Items – Sensitive data is safely stored in order to prevent it from being tampered. \n* Creates and Maintains Records of System Storage Activities – Logging and monitoring are required for this criterion as well. \n\n#### 4. Confidentiality \n\n* Restricts Logical Access– Access to sensitive cloud assets is limited, and the Least Privilege Principle is implemented. \n* Identifies and Authenticates Users – The company follows good practices regarding [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n#### 5. Privacy \n\n* Uses Encryption to Protect Data – All assets of type storage are encrypted. \n* Protects Identification and Authentication Credentials – Managing access to cloud assets is a matter of privacy since an entity that isn't authorized should not be able to access them. \n\n## How do you obtain the SOC 2 accreditation? \n\nThe process of obtaining it depends on the type of accreditation you’re going for. There are two types of SOC audits, which require different reports: \n\n* **Type 1:** a single audit and a single report are required at a specific date and time. For this type, the design of the security program put in place is evaluated. \n* **Type 2:** to obtain the SOC 2 Type 2 accreditation, an audit is carried out over a period of time, usually a minimum of six months. For type 2, the execution of the security program is evaluated. \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both types.  \n\nWhile type 1 requires less effort and is easier to get, it is also less valuable, since the evaluation result only reflects the state of the company's data security at a given point in time.  \n\nWith type 2, you invest more time and resources into getting accredited, but the result shows more effort and commitment toward the customer's [data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nOnce you’ve decided which SOC 2 type you want to obtain, you need to start the long process of obtaining the accreditation. \n\n## Use Cyscale to make this process easier for you \n\nCyscale can help you obtain the SOC 2 accreditation for your company by: \n\n* checking with the use of in-app controls whether you're implementing the requirements, \n* providing you with remediation steps for any findings, \n* helping you to demonstrate, during the audit, that you’re SOC 2 compliant and should receive the accreditation. \n\nIn the image below, you can see a part of the SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale, which gives you metrics to know how you're doing in your process of becoming compliant. \n\n![SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale](/img/blog_16-soc-2-page-in-cyscale.webp#shadow \"SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale\")\n\nA large set of technical controls included in this standard are mapped to SOC 2 points of focus to easily understand which ones you’re correctly implementing, and which require your attention. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","seoTitle":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","description":"A Hybrid Cloud infrastructure contains at least two different environments, which can be on-premises, in the public cloud and in a private cloud.

If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for Google Cloud. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","seoTitle":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","description":"Data classification is a way of grouping data to ensure easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.

Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in Google Cloud, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow Google Cloud customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your Google Cloud environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies","seoTitle":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies - Cyscale","description":"A CSPM product is a component of cloud security that uses controls to identify misconfigurations, sends targeted alerts to companies, provides step on how to remediate findings and helps you achieve compliance with international standards. 5 best practices and strategies are: ensure visibility of assets, classify assets and prioritize the most important ones, achieve compliance with international standards, monitor your infrastructure and ensure logging, remediate findings quickly.

Ensure visibility of assets\n\nIf you have a large number of assets, it is challenging to guarantee discovery and visibility and to find security design issues. \n\nBroad visibility and discovery of assets may help you identify: \n\n* misconfigurations that may cause vulnerabilities in your system, \n* poor access control, \n* weak data security, and others. \n\nBelow, you can see a section of Cyscale’s powerful dashboard, where you can also find the status of your controls, alerts, and others. \n\nThis inventory helps you keep track of assets and be aware of the different components in your cloud environment. \n\n![Dashboard inventory in Cyscale](/img/inventory-dashboard.webp#shadow \"Dashboard inventory in Cyscale\")\n\n#### 2. Classify assets and prioritize the most important ones\n\nAsset classification is very important; it will help you prioritize the assets with high risk and high importance. \n\nA company's security can be considerably improved by categorizing assets according to their risk and by setting remediation priorities. \n\n#### 3. Achieve compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and others.\n\nA CSPM can help you achieve compliance by: \n\nensuring your cloud environment is implementing requirements and best practices,  \n\nproviding evidence of your organization’s efforts and speeding up the auditing process. \n\nThere is a long list of international standards that regulate configurations of cloud environments: \n\n* ISO 27001,  \n* GDPR,  \n* HIPAA, \n* PCI-DSS, \n* NIST, and many more. \n\n![International compliance standards](/img/standards.webp#shadow \"International compliance standards\")\n\n#### 4. Monitor your infrastructure\n\nIdentifying threats early is crucial to preventing incidents. Keep logs and document every action and event to be able to respond to threats as they appear. \n\nMonitoring and logging your infrastructure can help you: \n\n* notice odd behavior, \n* identify misconfigurations, \n* provide accountability for employees’ and customers’ actions. \n\n#### 5. Remediate findings quickly\n\nSolving misconfigurations and responding to incidents promptly is essential – it can prevent a threat from becoming a breach.  \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are:  \n\n* implementing strong encryption for sensitive data, \n* eliminating administrator or root accounts that are not necessary, \n* using access lists and policies to restrict unwanted traffic. \n\nA CSPM can help you remediate failed controls and quickly patch your systems. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that can help you implement the best practices described in this article and even more. You can use over 400 controls and powerful dashboards to: \n\n* obtain visibility and discovery of your cloud environment, \n* manage high priority assets, \n* identify misconfigurations in a timely manner, \n* ensure compliance with international standards, \n* solve findings and ensure security.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":45,"numPages":9,"currentPage":6,"category":"All","seoTitle":"Blog Page 6 - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Cloud and Data Security Blog","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","IAM","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
