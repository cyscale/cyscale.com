According to these rules, the customer is entirely responsible for his security configuration. The cloud provider's responsibility is the data center's security only.\n\nOnce you understand that the security offered by cloud providers is insufficient against cloud threats, you might want to look for more efficient tools to secure your cloud assets.\n\nSo why should you consider using this type of tool?\n\nHere are just some of the [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/) capabilities that might make you want to start using one for your cloud infrastructure:\n\n## Misconfiguration detection and prevention\n\nMisconfigurations are most often caused due to a lack of visibility and mismanagement of interconnected resources.\n\nCloud infrastructures are complex, and they differ from one provider to the other, meaning that misconfigurations can easily happen, and the making of the organization can be vulnerable to attacks and open to the possibility of data breaches.\n\nLet's consider the CSPM your configuration drift prevention tool.\n\nIn many situations, a CSPM solution offers cross-cloud visibility, while potentially dangerous events are highlighted for you to see faster. (Events such as users' accounts being granted excessive permissions, having accidentally granted public access to storage buckets or containers, and other similar mistakes)\n\n## Compliance monitoring\n\nCloud resources being created and destroyed often, having data frequently duplicated across regions - these represent common events in a cloud infrastructure, but when it comes to managing compliance, they become challenges that were not encountered before, in an on-premises configuration.\n\nThe CSPM tools offer predefined frameworks for the most popular benchmarks and compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, NIST 800, PCI DSS, SOC 2, CCPA which may help you meet these challenges.\n\nOnce you have set up the policies you consider relevant, the CSPM will give you instant notifications for compliance drifts.\n\nBuilt-in remediation advice or actions are provided in some cases, making it easier for your team to have the dynamic approach needed to follow cloud compliance requirements.\n\n## Security investigation & Incident response\n\nTo effectively apply security best practices, you need to be able to visualize what assets exist, what is the current protection in place, and what are high-risk alerts that you need to attend to first.\n\nFast response in case of a security incident is crucial.\n\nHaving automated monitoring, misconfiguration detection and real-time analysis in your cloud security configuration is an important aspect when it comes to keeping your organization audit ready.\n\nCSPM solutions enable organizations to automate cloud security processes and evidence collection and help mitigate attacks.\n\n## Risk visualization & assessment\n\nThe CSPM will continuously monitor the cloud environments in real-time for threat detection.\n\nIt will automatically assess your security posture immediately after onboarding, and you will have the possibility to create policies that meet your needs.\n\nA quantifying risk will be presented for all detected security violations, so that you can prioritize solving the issues brought to your attention.\n\nThere are different approaches depending on the vendor, but one thing is clear: “The use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. (According to Gartner)\n\nYou just need to find the CSPM solution that suits your security and compliance needs and gives you the best possible visibility over your cloud assets.\n\nCyscale for example, has an innovative approach to CSPM, allowing you to map, secure, and monitor your cloud assets across platforms in less than 5 minutes after onboarding.\n\nThe solution is called Cyscale Cloud Platform, and it will most definitely help you understand how assets are interconnected.\n\nUnlike other CSPM solutions that provide you with endless lists of logs, Cyscale Cloud Platform makes it easy for you to understand context by placing your cloud assets in a unique Security Knowledge Graph™ view.\n\nIt will surface crucial issues of all your interlinked cloud assets, helping you improve your security and data governance procedures.\n\nComplete visibility over your infrastructure and deep contextual understanding of your cloud assets inventory is possible only by using the unique power of Cyscale Cloud Platform, so start your free trial today!\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n_Photo by [christina@wocintechchat.com](https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)_\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"How the largest Romanian real estate portal could have prevented a massive cloud data breach","seoTitle":null,"description":"The adoption of public cloud providers can bring many advantages to a business, but at the same time, cybersecurity threats can appear because of this usage.","seoDescription":null,"date":"2021-02-09T06:08:46.468Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"realestate-data-breach","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/data-breach.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/db3cc/data-breach.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/e33e3/data-breach.jpg 205w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/589dd/data-breach.jpg 410w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/db3cc/data-breach.jpg 820w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/db5a0/data-breach.jpg 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/f4465/data-breach.webp 205w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/c6392/data-breach.webp 410w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/df340/data-breach.webp 820w,\n/static/0d96ef08f179f8a175428ee2782df37a/2e599/data-breach.webp 1640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":316}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"\n### Can cloud misconfigurations affect your company?\n\nYes, they can! In this case, Romania's largest real estate portal has suffered a data breach due to a misconfiguration. Website Planet detected that the portal's AWS S3 buckets were publicly available without any protection, back in December 2020. As a result, more than 200,000 records were exposed.\n\nAnyone with the URL could access the buckets and Personal Identifying Information (PII) stored there. Users' data such as full names, emails, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (CNP), or even scanned copies of national ID cards including identifying codes were leaked.\n\nThe AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 Access Points feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help companies manage the public access to their resources. More information can be found on Amazon's Documentation Portal:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/\npremiumsupport/\nknowledge-center/\nread-access-objects-s3-bucket\n\nBy default, new buckets do not allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies and allow public access. Since these individual settings are customizations enabled to better suit a specific organization's needs, the responsibility is no longer with the cloud provider.\n\nEven if the unintentional breach was fixed after Website Planet reported it, the precise number of people affected remains unknown and the culpability for this data leak lies entirely with the real estate portal.\n\nThis could have easily been prevented with the implementation of a [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). These solutions are developed to [detect any misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and to prevent this type of event.\n\nAs a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cyscale Cloud Platform is the perfect tool that helps companies reduce risk. It enables complete visibility and control over cloud accounts in under 5 minutes since deployment.\n\nCyscale's platform is equipped with an alert mechanism, that detects and informs security and cloud ops about exposed assets and helps them address these issues in time.\n\nMistakes such as having your company's buckets exposed, without password protection or encryption can be detected and fixed in time, you just need someone to guide you. We are ready to assist you with your Cloud Security.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"Hello Darkness, my old friend!","seoTitle":null,"description":"At Cyscale, we see Darkness as a force for good.
