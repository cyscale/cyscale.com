Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in Google Cloud, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow Google Cloud customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your Google Cloud environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies","seoTitle":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies - Cyscale","description":"A CSPM product is a component of cloud security that uses controls to identify misconfigurations, sends targeted alerts to companies, provides step on how to remediate findings and helps you achieve compliance with international standards. 5 best practices and strategies are: ensure visibility of assets, classify assets and prioritize the most important ones, achieve compliance with international standards, monitor your infrastructure and ensure logging, remediate findings quickly.

Ensure visibility of assets\n\nIf you have a large number of assets, it is challenging to guarantee discovery and visibility and to find security design issues. \n\nBroad visibility and discovery of assets may help you identify: \n\n* misconfigurations that may cause vulnerabilities in your system, \n* poor access control, \n* weak data security, and others. \n\nBelow, you can see a section of Cyscale’s powerful dashboard, where you can also find the status of your controls, alerts, and others. \n\nThis inventory helps you keep track of assets and be aware of the different components in your cloud environment. \n\n![Dashboard inventory in Cyscale](/img/inventory-dashboard.webp#shadow \"Dashboard inventory in Cyscale\")\n\n#### 2. Classify assets and prioritize the most important ones\n\nAsset classification is very important; it will help you prioritize the assets with high risk and high importance. \n\nA company's security can be considerably improved by categorizing assets according to their risk and by setting remediation priorities. \n\n#### 3. Achieve compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and others.\n\nA CSPM can help you achieve compliance by: \n\nensuring your cloud environment is implementing requirements and best practices,  \n\nproviding evidence of your organization’s efforts and speeding up the auditing process. \n\nThere is a long list of international standards that regulate configurations of cloud environments: \n\n* ISO 27001,  \n* GDPR,  \n* HIPAA, \n* PCI-DSS, \n* NIST, and many more. \n\n![International compliance standards](/img/standards.webp#shadow \"International compliance standards\")\n\n#### 4. Monitor your infrastructure\n\nIdentifying threats early is crucial to preventing incidents. Keep logs and document every action and event to be able to respond to threats as they appear. \n\nMonitoring and logging your infrastructure can help you: \n\n* notice odd behavior, \n* identify misconfigurations, \n* provide accountability for employees’ and customers’ actions. \n\n#### 5. Remediate findings quickly\n\nSolving misconfigurations and responding to incidents promptly is essential – it can prevent a threat from becoming a breach.  \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are:  \n\n* implementing strong encryption for sensitive data, \n* eliminating administrator or root accounts that are not necessary, \n* using access lists and policies to restrict unwanted traffic. \n\nA CSPM can help you remediate failed controls and quickly patch your systems. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that can help you implement the best practices described in this article and even more. You can use over 400 controls and powerful dashboards to: \n\n* obtain visibility and discovery of your cloud environment, \n* manage high priority assets, \n* identify misconfigurations in a timely manner, \n* ensure compliance with international standards, \n* solve findings and ensure security.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"PCI-DSS Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"PCI-DSS Compliance in the Cloud","description":"PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is the standard provides the PCI-DSS certification and regulates credit and debit card transactions.

In the following section, we will explain and map them to Cyscale controls to show you how to achieve a robust [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). Here are the 12 conditions: \n\n#### 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. \n\nTraffic to and from sensitive environments should be heavily filtered and restricted. Some examples of controls in Cyscale that ensure proper implementation are:  \n\n* *Ensure 'Enable connecting to serial ports' is not enabled for VM Instance* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. \n\nThe first set of credentials attackers try when attempting to gain access to an account is the default one. You should always change the default passwords immediately after installing a feature.  \n\nAnother aspect to look out for is allowing default access configuration on cloud assets. \n\nExamples of controls that check if you’ve done this for the applications in your infrastructure are: \n\n* *Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users that have a console password* for AWS \n* *Ensure that Cloud Storage buckets are not anonymously or publicly accessible* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 3. Protect stored cardholder data. \n\nThis requirement covers encryption, hashing, masking of customer’s debit or credit card data, as well as other techniques. It is an essential step because, when implemented correctly, even if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, they will not be able to read it.  \n\nSome examples of controls that ensure you’re not storing unprotected data are: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure that ‘Data encryption’ is set to ‘On’ on a SQL Database* for Azure \n\n#### 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. \n\nAll cardholder data transmitted over the Internet should be encrypted, to prevent malicious entities from reading it while it is in transit. You can find below examples of controls that ensure this implementation: \n\n* *Ensure that 'Secure transfer required' is set to 'Enabled'* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure S3 Bucket Policy allows HTTPS requests* for AWS \n\n#### 5. Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. \n\nMake sure security [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are enforced in the workplace, and anti-virus software, applications, and operating systems are up to date. \n\n#### 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. \n\nThe following devices and systems should be continuously secured and patched when dealing with cardholder data and transactions: \n\n* operating systems on virtual machines, \n* databases, \n* networking devices, \n* applications. \n\nExamples of controls in Cyscale that ensure this recommendation is attained are: \n\n* *Ensure Kubernetes web UI / Dashboard is disabled* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that App Engine applications enforce HTTPS connections* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know. \n\nMake sure only authorized personnel has access to customer’s card information and implement the Least Privilege Principle with the following controls: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 8. Identify and authenticate access to system components. \n\nImplement a robust authentication system that does not allow weak password usage and ensures regular rotation of keys and credentials.  \n\nJust two of the many controls Cyscale uses to ensure this requirement is implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one symbol* for AWS \n\n#### 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data. \n\nAccess to databases, computers, servers and other devices should be heavily restricted. Cloud providers are in charge of physical access to these systems. \n\nMake sure your cloud provider is PCI-DSS compliant and follows this requirement. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are all PCI-DSS compliant and ensure that the physical medium is protected.   \n\n#### 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. \n\nImplement logging and monitoring and track the logs in order to identify any suspicious behavior. Some examples of controls that ensure you have logging implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Auditing' is set to 'On'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 11. Regularly test security systems and processes. \n\nUse applications and scanners to find vulnerabilities, malware, and other abnormalities in your systems. In addition, PCI-DSS guidelines recommend performing penetration testing on the infrastructure and applications. \n\n#### 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel. \n\nEnsure that your staff is aware of security best practices and is regularly trained.  \n\nImplement strong policies to keep malicious entities away from your company and your customer’s data. \n\nSome controls that help you implement this requirement are: \n\n* *Ensure no \"root\" user account access key exists* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Notify about alerts with the following severity' is set to 'High'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n \n\nThese requirements can be implemented in no time using Cyscale controls and the steps described in them. \n\nBelow, you can see a small part of the PCI-DSS standard page from the Cyscale platform, along with the first two requirements from the list we’ve discussed. \n\n![The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale](/img/1.webp#shadow \"The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale\")\n\nWe see a description and the controls necessary to ensure compliance by expanding the first requirement. The controls also contain steps on how to implement them. \n\n![The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale](/img/2.png#shadow \"The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale\")\n\n## Compliance levels \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/a-guide-to-the-4-pci-dss-compliance-levels), PCI-DSS has 4 levels of compliance, corresponding to the number of transactions processed by a company.  \n\nThe following [compliance](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) levels apply: \n\n* **Level 1:** over 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 2:** between 1 – 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 3:** between 20.000 – 1 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 4:** less than 20.000 transactions annually. \n\nBased on these levels, reporting and auditing differ.  \n\nAn audit is required once a year for all levels of PCI-DSS compliance, with different requirements: \n\n* a level 1 audit is performed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Internal Security Assessor (ISA), \n* an audit for levels 2, 3, and 4 can be completed with a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (QSA), \n* for level 1 and level 2 compliance, a Report of Compliance (RoC) must also be submitted to the acquiring bank. \n\n## Make this process easier for yourself \n\nConsidering the requirements presented in this article, it is not an easy task to become PCI-DSS compliant and obtain the certification. \n\nUse Cyscale in order to make sure you: \n\n* are correctly implementing technical requirements, \n* can demonstrate that your company is compliant. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find over 100 controls that will ensure PCI-DSS compliance and over 400 controls that will help you secure your cloud infrastructure and achieve compliance with other international standards, like GDPR, [ISO 27001, SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/), and many others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"Announcing the Cyscale for Startups Program ","seoTitle":"Startups Program","description":"By implementing an early cybersecurity program using the Cyscale Platform, startups can take advantage of our intensive cloud security research, up-to-date compliance frameworks mapping, and best practices in improving their security posture without spending too much or hiring specialized staff.

It is developed and deployed in the cloud in its entirety.  \n\nThis type of application is containerized, for example in Docker or Kubernetes, to ensure isolated, dependency-free environments, and most of the time uses microservices to divide tasks and provide granularity.  \n\n**Cloud-based applications** are built and run outside the cloud but have certain features integrated into the cloud. \n\nA **cloud-enabled or non-native application** is originally meant for an on-premises environment. It is built outside the cloud and later transferred into one, in order to enjoy some of its benefits. \n\n<div id=\"advantages\">\n\n## Advantages of going cloud-native\n\n</div>\n\nTo better understand the differences between cloud-native and on-premises apps that do not use cloud, we will look at the former’s advantages and disadvantages over the latter’s.\n\n### Speed \n\nNative applications are easier and faster to build and deploy than on-premises ones because no sophisticated software or hardware requirements need to be fulfilled. Moreover, updates are also implemented faster in a cloud-native architecture and require no downtime.\n\n### Cost \n\nThe cost of using cloud-native technology depends on the application but is generally lower since it does not require the purchase of expensive hardware. For example, instead of buying a computer, you use virtual machines.\n\nTypically, cloud-native applications only require software licenses or subscriptions. \n\n### Scalability \n\nSince cloud-native environments do not require hardware upgrades, they are scalable and adaptable to business requirements. \n\nAccording to [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation), an open source project, “cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications”. \n\n### Resiliency \n\nThe cloud is known for its resiliency against natural disasters, power outages and other incidents that may disrupt a cloud-enabled application. Native cloud workloads are therefore more resilient. \n\n### A serverless model \n\nCloud-native applications may work on a serverless model by leaving the provisioning and maintaining tasks to the cloud provider. This model simplifies the deployment steps and eases the developer's work, increasing productivity. \n\nMoreover, using this model, cloud-native applications can be launched only when needed, the code in serverless functions responding to triggers and consuming resources when necessary. An advantage is that costs are reduced for applications. \n\n<div id=\"guide-to-secure-cloud\">\n\n## How to secure your cloud-native application\n\n</div>\n\nAccording to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/), cloud-native security can be approached in 4 layers, called the 4 C’s: \n\n1. Code, \n2. Container, \n3. Cluster, \n4. Cloud. \n\n### Code \n\nThe inner layer of security refers to the code; it is the part the application’s developer has the most control over, yet it can be one of a hacker's most appealing attack surfaces. \n\nApplication code security is usually an underrated cybersecurity mechanism and neglecting it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Here are a few security practices for securing code: \n\n* **Sanitize input.** This can go a long way and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others. \n* **Use encryption.** Data at rest and data in transit should always be encrypted. Make sure you’re sending application data encrypted through TLS. \n* **Ensure modern cryptography.** Even if you’re using encryption and hashing, make sure that: \n\n  * You’re not using deprecated algorithms, such as DES for encryption and MD5 for hashing, Instead, use AES and SHA-256 or newer, which are the current standards. \n  * You’re storing cryptographic keys safely (and not in the source code). \n  * You’re rotating keys regularly to safeguard against brute-force attacks on them. \n* **Only open the ports you’re using.** Don’t forget open ports, especially on internet-facing applications. This is one of the ways attackers can gain access to the cloud infrastructure and infect it with malware. \n\n### Container \n\nThe next layer of security for native cloud is controlled at the container level. \n\nContainers are virtualization tools which allow you to run applications in isolated environments, separated from the hardware.  \n\nIf your application uses various technologies, you can install any needed packages and resolve dependencies in the container instead of on the host operating system. \n\nAnother useful feature of containers is that you can create container image templates and replicate environments without having to re-install tools and technologies. \n\nThe most known containerization services are Docker and Kubernetes.  \n\nDocker is a platform that enables developers to deploy applications in a containerized environment. Docker runs over a single node (machine), while Kubernetes is a container orchestration service. \n\nDocker and Kubernetes are usually seen as competitors, but they work very well together; Kubernetes can help manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. \n\nHowever, there are a few security issues that need to be addressed regarding containers security: \n\n* **Do not run containers as root.** Developers find it easier to run containers as root because they don't have to provide their password when executing an action that requires root privileges. However, this opens up a wide palette of vulnerabilities; any attacker that would gain access to the container would have root privileges and, therefore, the highest level of permissions. \n* **Reduce the attack surface.** If an attacker gains access to the container, make sure they cannot escalate their privileges or escape the container; eliminate the use of UNIX binaries that can be used to bypass rules, such as \"sed\" and \"awk\". \n* **Implement a strong network policy**—for example, filter traffic to and from the container and use firewalls to ensure robust security. \n\n### Cluster \n\nThe third layer for cloud-native security is managed in clusters. \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It comprises the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining for example which application is running in which container. \n\nThe nodes that are part of a cluster run the applications. \n\nLet’s understand how to protect clusters with the following security solutions:\n\n* **Implement Authentication.** This step requires the user to prove they are who they claim to be. The authentication process may be different from service to service, but it can require credentials like passwords, client certificates, tokens, and others. \n* **Implement Authorization.** Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes authorization by assigning roles to users and managing their privileges at role level to ensure application security. \n* **Control what privileges containers run with.** Establish permissions by using security contexts. These are settings that can be applied to a container or a set of containers inside a cluster that define privileges and access control. \n\n### Cloud \n\nThe outer layer of a cloud-native application refers to cloud infrastructure and configuration. Let’s see how to fix [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and secure your cloud-native application against attackers. \n\n* **Restrict inbound and outbound traffic.** Make sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to blacklist ranges of IPs and ports.  \n* **Ensure compliance with the Least Privilege Principle.** Make sure no user has more privileges than required to carry out their tasks and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n* **Implement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.** Ensure that no one can read databases, files, and other resources if they gain access to your company's cloud. \n\nYou can identify misconfigurations in the cloud and remediate them effectively using the Cyscale security platform.\n\nThe Cyscale Cloud Platform offers a [CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/) security tool that: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities using security controls, \n* provides integration with the most important public cloud service providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, and supports multi-cloud environments,\n* sends relevant alerts,  \n* provides remediation steps to help your security teams protect your cloud environment effectively and overcome security challenges, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Product"],"title":"Creating a Security Knowledge Graph™ Through Integrations","seoTitle":"Creating a Security Knowledge Graph™ Through Integrations","description":"A knowledge graph is the perfect tool to analyze your cloud environment and observe employees' workflows and possible vulnerabilities.

So, let's see how you can do it.\n\n## What is the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is a data model based on deep understanding that maps cloud assets and their relationships, as well as information from adjacent data sources to provide context-aware security and deliver a comprehensive security analysis over an organization. \n\n**Google uses a Knowledge Graph** to power the results of its search engine by keeping a database of billions of records. \n\nThat is how [Google](https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176?hl=en) is able to answer questions accurately with context. \n\nThe Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™ is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between all of your cloud assets, as well as other apps and systems that may affect cloud security posture, and automatically pinpoints security issues.  \n\nThe graph is more than just a way to visualize assets and systems; it uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities. \n\n## Why use a Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nYou could go through sets of configuration best practices and verify them against each cloud resource.  \n\nHowever, when looked at in isolation, a resource may be misconfigured, but the relations it has with other assets, as well as its position in the network (for example, if it’s in a private network or if it is Internet-facing) may greatly influence the criticality of the situation. \n\nThe Security Knowledge Graph™ is built on top of a graph database that contains nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns to create comprehensive graphs. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a Security Knowledge Graph™.  \n\nNotice how a very complex system with intricate relationships and hidden vulnerabilities is so much easier to understand and observe when looking at it in a graph. \n\n![The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](/img/2-general.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n## Are you unsure if you need the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nLet me show you why you do!  \n\nRead the following scenarios to see if you can find your company in any of the situations described.  \n\n### Scenario 1: HR and identity providers \n\nAn employee joins the company and is onboarded using an HR management tool, such as BambooHR or Workday. \n\nAn account is created for the employee using an identity provider such as [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/), through which they receive access to a production [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) account, GitHub, and many other sensitive applications that may end up having an effect on the company's cloud infrastructure. \n\nWhen the employee leaves the company, they are offboarded from the HR portal, and the human resources department thinks the employee's accounts were completely deprovisioned.  \n\nHowever, since the Okta administrator did not correctly deprovision his account, the former employee **still has access to production code**. \n\n![HR and identity providers scenario in a graph](/img/3-scenariu-1.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 2: Misconfigured permissions \n\nIt is not uncommon to have employees with very similar names within the same company. For example, assume user John Smith, a software developer, and Jonathan Smith, an accountant, are both employees at the same company. \n\nThey are mistaken for one another and instead of John, the software developer, it is Jonathan who receives the credentials instead, thus gaining access to a sensitive account.  \n\nWhile trying to understand the reasoning behind this, Jonathan explores the account and accidentally **deletes a resource from the cloud**. \n\n![Misconfigured permissions in graph](/img/4-scenariu-2.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 3: False positives in vulnerability scans \n\nA company uses Tenable or CrowdStrike, endpoint vulnerability scanners.  \n\nA virtual machine running an application with Log4J has the Log4Shell vulnerability. As a result, critical alerts are generated, and the software engineers will prioritize this issue over other current vulnerabilities. \n\nHowever, Log4J is only running in a private network, not accessible from the Internet. The issue still needs to be addressed, but the severity is high instead of critical. \n\n**Instead of securing Internet-facing applications and devices, engineers are distracted by less essential tasks** due to contextless alerts. \n\n![False positives in vulnerability scans](/img/5-scenariu-3.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nKeep in mind that these are some examples. There are plenty of other situations where contextual awareness is the best way to notice existing vulnerabilities before they become breaches. \n\n  \n\n[Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) is leading a continuous effort to integrate as many services and tools as possible and expand the Knowledge Graph to cover a great range of security scenarios. \n\nWe currently integrate with: \n\n* AWS (Amazon Web Services), \n* Google Cloud, \n* Microsoft Azure, \n* Alibaba Cloud, \n* Okta, and others. \n\nThere are many more integrations to come soon: AWS SSO, GitHub, Azure AD, Kubernetes, GSuite. \n\n![Integrations in Cyscale](/img/6-tabel.webp#shadow \"Integrations in Cyscale\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Announcing the Playground!

If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":45,"numPages":8,"currentPage":6,"category":"All","seoTitle":"Blog Page 6 - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Cloud and Data Security Blog","categoriesList":["CSPM","Product","News","Compliance","CNAPP","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
