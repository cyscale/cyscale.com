Buckets are object storage services and are similar to folders; this type of storage is flexible and scalable and is ideal for large files and unstructured data. \n\n## Common S3 Bucket Misconfigurations \n\n### 1. Public access to a bucket is allowed. \n\nSometimes, Amazon S3 buckets are required to be publicly accessible. For example, this use case occurs when the owner intends to make data accessible to the internet.  \n\nHowever, breaches occur when a bucket that has sensitive information such [as PII (Personal Identifiable Information)](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) allows: \n\n* Public “READ” access, \n* Public “WRITE” access.  \n\nYou can grant and deny access to a bucket using **access lists** and **bucket policies**.  \n\nAn access control list (ACL) is a set of rules that limit access to buckets through permissions. It defines an account's access level over a bucket (for example, READ or WRITE).  \n\nA bucket policy also contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied, but it is a more modern solution because it can enable more complex filtering. It is a JSON-based access policy language. \n\nAmazon recommends that you no longer use ACLs beside special cases, in which you need to filter access to objects individually.  \n\n### 2. No at rest encryption is performed. \n\n[Data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) should always be encrypted to ensure confidentiality and improve your cloud data security.  \n\nPerforming encryption on the objects inside a bucket ensures that, even if a malicious entity gains access to your data, they cannot read it.  \n\nAWS provides multiple encryption options to protect data at rest. For example, you can enable default encryption and set it, so it automatically encrypts any new objects added to the bucket.  \n\nEncryption should be done using industry-recommended algorithms and strong cryptographic keys. A strong encryption algorithm is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 3. In transit encryption is not enabled. \n\nBesides the data that is already stored, you should also encrypt the data that travels to and from the S3 bucket.  \n\nThis step prevents eavesdropping attacks. It is not enough to store your data encrypted. Your efforts are wasted if it travels in plain text and attackers can read it. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nAnother solution for in motion encryption is preparing the data that is to be transported by encrypting it on the client-side. \n\n### 4. Logging is disabled. \n\nLogging an S3 bucket is an essential step in securing your data. With logging, you can record actions taken by users, keep log files for compliance purposes and understand what roles have permission to access data inside a bucket. \n\nThere are two solutions for AWS bucket logging: \n\n* Server access logging, and \n* AWS CloudTrail. \n\nWith server access logging, you obtain detailed records regarding requests that are made to a bucket. \n\nAWS CloudTrail is a comprehensive service that tracks user activity and API calls. It can be used to keep a record of who sends requests to a bucket.  \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that AWS CloudTrail does not log failed authentication attempts through incorrect credentials. However, it does track requests made by anonymous or unauthorized users. \n\n### 5. No regular backups are performed \n\nAttackers may not only try to steal your sensitive data, but they can also delete it. Therefore, ensuring regular and consistent backups is essential to configuring your buckets and providing availability. \n\nUsing AWS Backup, you can perform S3 bucket backups. Amazon supports the following types of backups: \n\n* **Continuous backups**, which allow data restoration from any moment in the last 35 days, \n* **Periodic backups**, which can be performed every 1 hour, 12 hours, or less often. \n\nAn important feature of AWS Backup is that [tags](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/), access control lists, and other metadata are also saved along with your data. \n\nAn additional layer of security can be added by using the MFA delete feature in AWS. This option requires a successful MFA before allowing a user to delete an object or bucket. \n\nMoreover, you can keep multiple versions of an object inside a bucket. This process is called versioning and can be used to recover objects from accidental deletion. \n\n## Do you have a complete cloud security program? \n\nIn this article, we’ve discussed many possible misconfigurations, along with best practices. However, in order to fully understand your public cloud infrastructure and find vulnerabilities, you need to have good visibility over your cloud environment.  \n\nUsing a new feature in Cyscale, the bucket graph, you can put in context all of your knowledge and grasp a better understanding of your infrastructure. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a bucket graph. \n\n![Bucket Graph in Cyscale](/img/23_blog-graph-bucket.webp#shadow \"Bucket Graph in Cyscale\")\n\nAlthough the bucket (shown on the right) has only two IAM policies attached, we can see that these have a significant impact on the infrastructure: the AmazonS3FullAccess policy gives full access rights to a specific user and to a VM that can assume an associated IAMRole.  \n\nIn addition, there's a lambda function that has a role which gives it permissions to perform actions on the bucket \n\nWithout context, we would not be able to understand a policy's impact and the associated risk. \n\nMoreover, the icon on the right shows us that the bucket violates three policies. Cyscale users can click on the icon and obtain more details regarding this alert. \n\nThis feature helps you quickly understand and fix any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities introduced in the cloud environment due to the bucket’s settings. \n\n  \n\nBesides the graph, you can also use controls to check your cloud configurations easily. Find any gaps in your buckets' configurations using Cyscale controls! Here are a few examples that can help you instantly check the most common misconfigurations regarding S3 buckets: \n\n* *Ensure S3 bucket ACL grants permissions only to specific AWS accounts* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* \n* *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes* \n* *Ensure that there are no publicly accessible objects in storage buckets* \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Misconfigurations"],"title":"Common Cloud Misconfigurations and How to Avoid Them","seoTitle":"Common Cloud Misconfigurations and How to Avoid Them","description":"Cloud misconfigurations are the number one reason for security breaches.

Poor storage access configuration \n2. Broken access control \n3. Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic \n4. Missing encryption \n5. Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring \n\nThis article will explain these misconfigurations and help you work them out.  \n\nWe will also give you some examples of the controls Cyscale implements to ensure foolproof configurations for your company’s cloud. \n\n<div id=\"storage-access\">\n\n## **1. Poor storage access configuration**\n\nStorage access misconfigurations usually make cloud assets open to the public view. \n\nWe can take as an example Amazon S3 buckets. A significant security vulnerability is making an S3 bucket that contains sensitive data public. This means that everyone on the internet can access your data. \n\nThere are two ways in which public access over a bucket can lead to cybersecurity incidents: \n\n* Public “READ” access \n* Public “WRITE” access \n\nPublic “READ” access over a company’s buckets creates the risk of a data breach.  \n\n“WRITE” access over a bucket is arguably worse – this means that entities from the internet can infiltrate malware such as \n\n* backdoors,\n* ransomware,\n\nor even crowd your bucket with their data in order to obtain free storage. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nBlock public access using access lists and policies.  \n\nAn access control list (ACL) is a set of rules that limit access to buckets through permissions. It defines the access level an account has over a bucket (for example, READ or WRITE). \n\nLet’s look at some examples of controls offered by Cyscale that check if you have storage access misconfigurations: \n\n* *Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with 'Block public access (bucket settings)'* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure network access rule for storage bucket is not set to publicly accessible* for Alibaba Cloud\n\n</div>\n\n## **2. Broken access control**\n\nWhen talking about access control misconfigurations, we refer to overly permissive rights. \n\nThe Principle of Least Privilege states that a user should not be given more permissions than they need to perform their job. \n\nBadly implemented access control can lead to cybersecurity incidents because: \n\n* an employee may accidentally misconfigure other assets because they are given the right to, even though they shouldn’t have it, \n* an attacker that gets ahold of an employee’s account may leverage the broad range of permissions they have to further penetrate the infrastructure or gain access to secrets. \n\nAdministrator or root privileges should only be given to those users who absolutely require them. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nRestrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\nTwo examples of the many controls Cyscale has that regulate this issue are: \n\n* *Ensure that ServiceAccount has no Admin privileges* for Google Cloud Platform \n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS Cloud \n\nAnother best practice to mention is having groups with very well-defined rules and privileges. \n\nIn this way, you can assign a user to the correct group and minimize the risk of making a mistake when adding permissions for a new user or when trying to manage multiple users. \n\nThe implementation of this feature is checked by Cyscale using, for example, the following controls: \n\n* *Ensure IAM Users receive permissions only through Groups* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure RAM policies are attached only to groups or roles* for Alibaba Cloud \n\n## **3. Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic**\n\nWhen we talk about cloud networking, we have two types of traffic: \n\n1. Inbound\n2. Outbound\n\nEach one involves a different type of risk. \n\nWith inbound traffic, unnecessarily open ports may be a door inside for an attacker. \n\nOn the other hand, outbound unrestricted traffic allows a perpetrator to: \n\n* exfiltrate data \n* pivot to other assets in your cloud environment (otherwise known as lateral movement) \n* scan your infrastructure and gather data about your company \n\n### **Solution**\n\nMake sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to restrict ranges of IPs and ports. \n\nLet’s look at two of the hundreds of controls implemented in Cyscale that restrict unnecessary traffic from your cloud.  \n\n* *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic for MySQL (port 3306)* for Google Cloud Platform \n* *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on all ports* for Google Cloud Platform \n\n## **4. Missing encryption**\n\nWhen we’re considering encryption in the cloud, there are numerous cloud assets we need to have in mind. For example: \n\n* S3 buckets, \n* virtual machine disks, \n* databases and others. \n\nEncryption assures confidentiality. If your sensitive data is accidentally exposed or someone gains access to it, strong encryption can still protect it. \n\nTherefore, it is important to make sure your data is encrypted in the cloud. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nImplement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.  \n\nSome examples of controls implemented in Cyscale that check if encryption is correctly assured in your cloud environment are: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure that 'Data encryption' is set to 'On' on a SQL Database* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for Google Cloud Platform \n\n## **5. Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring**\n\nIt is extremely important to log actions taken in your cloud environment. This can help you: \n\n* identify mistakes and other misconfigurations \n* provide accountability for employees’ actions \n* notice suspicious behavior \n\nMoreover, a key feature would be having targeted alerts alongside logging. This can help you cut through the noise of logs. \n\nEffectiveness can be increased in this way because you do not have to skim through all of the generated logs, since targeted alerts point out specific problems.\n\n### **Solution**\n\nImplement logging and monitoring with automated, targeted alerts. \n\nSome of the many controls provided by Cyscale that help you configure logging correctly are: \n\n* *Ensure that activity log alert exists for the Delete Network Security Group Rule* for Microsoft Azure\n* *Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket* for AWS Cloud\n\n<br/>\n\nNow that we’ve looked at the most common cloud misconfigurations and showed you how to identify and fix them, make sure to check out [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) to solidify your cloud security posture.  \n\nYou will find: \n\n* controls that check for the misconfigurations presented in this article and more,\n* an explanation of what those misconfigurations are,\n* instructions on how to fix them.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"Misconfigurations","seoTitle":"Cloud Misconfigurations - Expert Insights and Tips | Cyscale Blog","seoDescription":"Navigate the complexities of cloud misconfigurations.
