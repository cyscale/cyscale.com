Or at least not entirely.\n\nThe trend over the past few years has been clear: shift left. The idea is to identify and prevent issues (not only security-related) as soon as possible. This implies more collaboration during the day-to-day development and even mixed teams that handle all the aspects of the product (there is no limit to how many words we can fit between “Dev” and “Ops”).\n\nWhile some might be inclined to believe organizations are doing this just to cut down costs (of course this is one of the reasons and it should be), the reality is that the team that builds the product also knows the product best. A virtual machine that can theoretically be accessed on port 22 (SSH) from any IP might mean a security hazard to someone that sees the system for the first time. On the other hand, the team will probably have more context and will be able to provide a more accurate risk assessment - maybe the VM is not actually accessible over the internet because it's deployed in a private subnet. Context matters.\n\nAnd the truth is that most teams will happily take on more responsibility and/or collaborate closely with their colleagues. Actually, the best teams want and demand this. They want to contribute to the architecture of the product, be involved in the risk assessments, and help with sales. They will gladly do this as long as the **purpose is clear** and **the job involves actually building something** (this is what software engineers refer to as fun).\n\nOn the other hand, pursuing something like compliance with ISO 27001 which involves reading and writing a lot, might be met with some resistance. While some might get “fooled” when being told they will **build** an Information Security Management **System** (**ISMS** from now on), most people will stop listening when they hear compliance (are you still reading this?). But it doesn't have to be like this.\n\nBeing compliant is a huge selling point and many well-established customers will even require this from their service providers. One missing product feature will probably not make or break the deal, but missing compliance will.\n\n## The Standard\n\nThe ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard is targeted towards information security. It guides us in the process of building an ISMS that takes a holistic approach (i.e. look at the facts from multiple perspectives) to achieve better **confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our assets (i.e. reduce risks)**.\n\nSince it can be applied in a wide range of industries and companies, ISO 27001 provides general recommendations and approaches. It doesn't tell us how to do anything and there is no recipe for success. **Looking through a simplified view, ISO 27001 guides us through our journey of discovering our assets, identifying risks, and devising strategies for eliminating, mitigating, and remediating the relevant risks.** These can go from ensuring we use encryption to having a designated responsible for contacting authorities when bad things happen (and they will happen).\n\nSo basically it helps us document how we protect our assets. Now, these assets can be anything from physical devices (e.g. laptops) to data stored in an S3 bucket. The standard covers all kinds of assets and situations such as a new employee joining the company (how are they assigned access? have we performed the relevant background checks?) or segregating our networks based on users and services.\n\nIn fact, ISO 27001 provides 114 controls structured in 14 sections (called clauses), each covering a specific area. For example, clause A.13 refers to communications security and has two objectives:\n\n-   Network security management\n-   Information transfer\n\nBoth objectives contain several so-called **controls** that aim to help us **reduce the risk** when applicable. One of the controls, A.13.2.3, refers to _Electronic messaging_ and says the following:\n\n_Information involved in electronic messaging shall be appropriately protected._\n\nThe control tells us what should be achieved, but doesn't tell us how. This is where the compliance team and the development team (usually represented by the architect) start gathering information. Their duty is to research the options and possibilities they have and to find out how the system/application handles it currently.\n\n### Translating ISO controls to the cloud\n\nAssuming they are building their software on top of a hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), they might start by enforcing HTTPS traffic through security groups/firewalls and leveraging private subnets. This should be good enough for virtual machines, but their applications might use more services such as object storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS), load balancers, managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, the Azure SQL suite of services), integration services such as queueing and pub/sub systems, and the list goes on and on (and probably got longer while you were reading this article).\n\nAfter 6 days of research, they might have identified the following options, let's say on AWS:\n\n1. Since they have been using AWS for the past 9 years, they have to make sure all their EC2 instances are migrated and deployed in a VPC, as opposed to EC2-Classic.\n2. The security groups attached to the load balancers should allow traffic only on port 443.\n3. The load balancers should have TLS listeners set up and accept only safe cipher suites - e.g. it shouldn't accept TLS 1.0 or older SSL protocols that are considered unsafe.\n4. The security groups attached to virtual machines running the application should only accept traffic from the load balancer.\n5. Self-hosted databases such as Elasticsearch should only accept traffic from the EC2 instances running the application.\n6. RDS instances should not be publicly accessible and should only accept traffic from the same EC2 instances.\n7. S3 buckets should have a bucket policy that enforces HTTPS.\n8. S3 buckets should not allow public access through the bucket policy or the ACL (some buckets are pretty old so they heavily rely on ACLs).\n9. And finally, since they leverage AMIs, they would like to ensure that these are private.\n\nCovering all these should provide a great starting point to ensure electronic messaging security. The compliance team adds them to the policy (remember, the output of ISO 27001 is an ISMS which is a set of policies), the development team configures the infrastructure, and the target is achieved. Or is it?\n\n### If it hurts, do it more often\n\n**Adopting a standard means setting a new bar**. It means that all changes from now on must respect the new rules. Of course, the development team is unlikely to print the security policies and attach them to their wall so the product owner creates tasks with checklists as part of their stories. Everything is great now. Every time they add a new cloud resource all they have to do is to go through a 235 items checklist. And also they have to add the resource to their asset inventory.\n\nBeing smart engineers, the development team decides to use AWS Config and implement custom rules to perform these checks whenever a resource is changed. They plan to implement this over the next 4 months and try to keep the compliance team in the loop because they don't want to deal with a stack of Word documents (even though they represent the heart and soul of the compliance team).\n\nNow, if your organization is at this point, you adopted the DevOps culture at this level and you have all these resources, you will probably be fine. Of course, you will have to:\n\n1. practically spam all your employees with presentations about the policies\n2. train and retrain everyone involved including every new employee\n3. wonder whether anyone has actually ever read the policies\n4. wonder whether your research was comprehensive enough\n5. oppose adopting any new cloud provider because it would mean implementing and mapping all the controls again and again\n\n**However, if this sounds like a lot of work to do and/or you want to take your [ISO 27001 Compliance & Cloud Security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) to the next level by giving power to your policies and ultimately to your people, check out [cyscale.com](https://app.cyscale.com/ 'https://app.cyscale.com/').**\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"HITRUST (Health Information Trust) Alliance is the organization that established the HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework), a framework for managing and securing information in the healthcare industry.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant: Making Cloud Security More Intuitive","seoTitle":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant | Cyscale","description":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","seoDescription":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","date":"2023-11-02T13:00:05.768Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/blog-cover-ai-assistant.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/41be8/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/c78f7/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/913d0/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/91660/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/888e2/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Cyscale, [the platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily,](https://cyscale.com/) is excited to give a first glimpse into the potential enabled by generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM),  unveiling our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question. \n\nAs engineers we’ve spent almost 20 years working with the cloud, and the complexity of cloud environments mean it’s now impossible to correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually to expose real risk, especially if you have a small team.  \n\nGenerating security alerts is not the problem. The problem is understanding them in context, and it's getting harder for a CTO or CISO to [prioritize remediation because of the volume of alerts](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/).   \n\nWe think context is king, and the value of Cyscale is in our application of graph technology to inventory all cloud assets and the relationships between those assets to [identify and prioritize real security threats](https://cyscale.com/blog/contextual-security-google-cloud/).   \n\nNow with developments in AI we are taking this value even further by enabling our platform to automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues using our customers’ cloud footprint combined with Large Language Models (LLM) of vulnerabilities and exploits.    \n\nIn our first look at Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant you can see how we’re making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\n## D﻿emonstration of Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant\n <br class=\"\" />\n \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/boWgsssdTDI?si=0IfNfAnUTRMWpvf8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe key value here is the democratization of cloud security. Regardless of your skill level, the Security Assistant connects all the dots between disparate information sources so you don’t have to. This means security practitioners struggling to keep up with technical tasks can get information that’s relevant to them, just the same as compliance officers can get information about security posture through a lens that’s more relevant to their interests.  \n\nThis example shows you just the very tip of what’s possible by asking the Assistant questions such as:  \n\n* Which security controls have failed?   \n* What are my top three vulnerabilities and their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score?  \n* How can I fix these vulnerabilities on their specific cloud platform?   \n\n## Democratizing cloud security with AI\n\nNot only does this approach help people in different functions (security, DevOps, compliance) get information that’s more contextually relevant to their role, it helps them perform tasks faster by giving links directly to the affected assets in question, and clear instructions on how to fix associated issues.   \n\nIt also helps security professionals navigate multi-cloud environments by abstracting the unique and different terminologies used from one cloud provider to another (‘termination’ versus ‘deallocation’ for example) into more natural language. \n\n> “Cybersecurity may have become cloud security, but it’s becoming less and less human friendly,” says Ovidiu Cical, Cyscale CEO. “It’s now impossible for a CTO, CISO, or security practitioner to stay on top of an endless list of alerts and things that need fixing without automation. Companies like us have made great strides in automating these processes and providing context but it’s still a lot of information for small teams to digest and act on.” \n>\n> “With these rapid developments in AI assistance we can help different kinds of people interact with our tools in a more natural and contextually relevant way. AI is actually making cloud security more human,” Ovidiu adds.   \n\nThis is important because [Gartner estimates that 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure), mainly through failures to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. Automation puts people back in control by helping them better manage cloud complexity, security, and compliance. \n\nCyscale’s Security Assistant is still in development, so stay tuned for more insights into the potential unlocked by AI, but existing customers and new prospects can request to have it added to their account for testing.  \n\n[B﻿ook a demo to see](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) it in action.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","seoTitle":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures due to failure to disclose significant cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities over at least a two-year period.

Moreover, they have routinely overstated their cybersecurity best practices and misled investors.  \n\nSEC’s complaint seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown”, SolarWinds’ CISO. \n\nSEC’s actions show that cybersecurity should be taken seriously and should include adequate prevention as well as remediation strategies, otherwise companies may face serious legal consequences.  \n\nIt is important to identify ongoing risks and apply effective measures to increase security posture, but also to take an objective and realistic view. The SEC statement reveals that an internal document from SolarWinds’ mentions that “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”  \n\nThis is not an uncommon predicament. Companies frequently find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to security issues and often fail to allocate enough funds and personnel to rectify them. Furthermore, ‘alert fatigue’ is a rapidly growing problem, where security tools generate so many alerts that assessing and fixing them becomes an impossible task.  \n\nThis is one of the key issues Cyscale set out to solve. Through the application of context to each security alert, Cyscale’s mission is to help companies overcome the challenges of slim resources and budgets by prioritizing security issues and guiding professionals to work on the 20% of things that matter and make 80% of the difference.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","seoTitle":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","description":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","seoDescription":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","date":"2023-10-24T11:26:33.738Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cyscale-europas-hottest-cybersecurity-startup","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/cyscale-europas-awards.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg","srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/41be8/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/c78f7/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/913d0/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/91660/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/888e2/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"We are super excited to reveal that Cyscale – the [platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily](https://cyscale.com/) – has made the longlist for The Europas Awards 2023.  \n\n[The Europas,](https://www.theeuropas.com/) founded by Tech Crunch’s Mike Butcher, has been Europe’s most prestigious startup awards program for the last 15 years and has been instrumental in identifying some of the world’s most ambitious and successful startups, including Spotify, Deliveroo, Wise, and Starling Bank among many others.  \n\nCyscale entered the awards along with 400 other European startups and has made the cut in the cybersecurity category against five other entrants.  \n\n“It’s great to see Cyscale acknowledged among the Europas nominees as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security,” said Cyscale CEO Ovidiu Cical.  \n\n“Over 400 startups entered these awards and all of them are building their game-changing applications in the cloud. Some companies are even targeting regulated sectors like fintech, healthtech, and insuretech, where security and compliance are critical factors,” Ovidiu added.  \n\n“While the cloud has become the great enabler for these innovations, it’s also the complexity of the cloud that is killing businesses. There are now more controls and configurations than is humanly possible to keep track of, and one mistake – one misconfiguration or vulnerability in your cloud – can cost you your reputation and your business,” he said.  \n\nCyscale is pioneering the application of cloud security for other startups, scaleups, and SaaS builders by focusing on ease of use and time to value. The CTO or CISO of a startup building out its tech stack doesn’t have the time or the skillset to spend days in every week chasing security alerts.  \n\nSo, Cyscale empowers these companies by not only automatically identifying security problems, but also giving the context needed to prioritize remediation and providing guidance on how to fix issues.  \n\nCyscale is already helping companies secure and monitor their multi-cloud assets and data with our context-driven approach, and we are now looking to harness the power of AI to replace existing security tools with prompts and make an automated and scalable security team available to every cloud-centric company. This recognition by The Europas validates our approach. \n\nGood luck to all the entrants!
