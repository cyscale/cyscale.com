Network administrators in legacy systems invest significant effort into securing routers, adding firewalls and ensuring that all network devices function correctly. In the cloud, under the shared responsibility model, the customer does not deal with physical devices anymore, and security is shifted to identity and access control, known as [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), which focuses on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets.  \n\n## Why is IAM important? \n\nIf a user with high privileges is compromised in the cloud, a situation can escalate to critical levels quickly leaving vulnerable apps and data exposed; this is why IAM is the first and most important line of defense against attackers.  \n\n## How do you manage IAM in the cloud? \n\nNowadays, every employee has multiple accounts for different tools they use, such as HR applications, a CRM or ERP solution, various cloud platforms, and more. We do not live in a world where one person equals one account to manage, meaning the process of securing access is complicated from the start.  \n\nA single developer or other IT employee might need to have access to multiple cloud environments, a version control system, a deployment platform, and a ticket management system, and if you multiply that by 10 or 100 employees the number of accounts or users you need to manage is quickly getting into the hundreds or thousands.  \n\nIt’s impossible to manually handle so many accounts and ensure that they’re all properly secured, granted appropriate permissions, and correctly deprovisioned when employees leave.  \n\n### Key IAM processes: The access management lifecycle   \n\nLet’s take a look at the key stages in the access management lifecycle, keeping in mind that these processes need to apply to the individual and all the user accounts they are associated with: \n\n* **Onboarding:** the first stage involves creating a new user, assigning roles to it and providing permissions over resources. \n* **Role management:** in this stage, roles are already defined and configured for users. New roles and permissions may be added based on needs. \n* **Access review:** these are periodic evaluations of permissions assigned to users, groups, or roles. This stage involves reviewing and validating that individuals or entities have appropriate access levels based on their current roles and responsibilities. \n* **Offboarding:** This stage is crucial and involves removing users from the company's systems, revoking permissions and disabling accounts, thus preventing unauthorized access after an individual leaves the organization. \n\n### Centralizing IAM processes in the cloud \n\nIn order to handle an impossible workload and ensure due process is followed each and every time, centralization has become key. Let’s look at best practices to secure [IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) throughout the identity lifecycle. \n\n### SSO (Single Sign-On) \n\nOften, companies will deploy multiple cloud accounts, and the best practice is to organize these using provider specific mechanisms (ie. Organizations and Folders in AWS, Management Groups in Azure, etc.). Managing identities at cloud account level would quickly become unmanageable and it’s best to keep those at a minimum. \n\nA cloud company should use an identity provider (whether that’s one built-in into the cloud service provider, such as Azure AD, or an external SSO provider, like [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/)) to manage cloud access, as opposed to having multiple users defined within individual cloud accounts. \n\nManaging identities in a central location, as well as using SSO, are key elements of ensuring IAM security in the cloud. These are the risks of not using SSO in your company: \n\n1. **Password fatigue leading to security issues.** Having users input their passwords multiple times a day and for different applications can and probably will lead to them re-using the same password across multiple platforms or using very simple, easy to remember passwords. No-one wants to pull out the password manager 20 times a day. Password fatigue can lead to credentials leak and may put a company in danger.  \n2. **Long-term credentials accidentally disclosed or stolen.** Managing cloud access at individual account level implies creating long-term credentials such as passwords or access keys. Through SSO, temporary credentials are used and they expire after the user's session. This helps mitigate the risk of long-term credential exposure, because even if these temporary credentials were to be leaked, they would only be valid for a short period.\n3. **It’s overall a better user experience.**  \n\n### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) \n\nThis is considered essential. To clarify the point: your employees should not have any accounts without MFA. Whether they’re using a passwordless solution, or still using passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone, but especially for high-privilege users.  \n\nWe can’t labor this point enough. There are so many breaches that could have been prevented with MFA! For example, [Deloitte suffered an incident in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails) where the company’s clients were affected just because an administrative account did not have MFA. Emails, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and even health data were at risk. \n\nIn 2014, Home Depot had an estimated 56 million payment cards exposed after a third-party vendor’s stolen login details were used to breach the company. Again, MFA could have prevented such a breach. \n\nIf you’re already using SSO in your company, you should enforce an MFA policy at the identity provider level and better manage this setting for all your users. \n\nWe even demonstrated how MFA can prevent an attack from spreading in an Azure cloud environment, you can read that article [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/compromising-azure-cloud-as-guest/). \n\nBeware however that threat actors are innovating in this space too. A newish social engineering type approach known as an MFA Fatigue attack sees hackers relentlessly pushing MFA access requests to users’ endpoint devices and combining this with stolen logins to try and wear down a user to the point where they accidently allow access.  \n\n### Get full visibility of users and accounts \n\nYou can’t secure what you can’t see (or you don’t know about). So, it’s impossible to have a good security posture in the cloud without full visibility of all your assets, your people and their respective user accounts, role assignments, groups, and so on. \n\nThis is why a centralized solution for access review is the best approach to managing this challenge: having all permissions, roles, and user accounts visible via one single dashboard is very attractive for security professionals trying to manage access in the cloud. \n\nIn the image below we notice how one single person has permissions over Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, GitHub, and other environments. Besides this, we see the effective permissions assigned to each cloud account or application, security information such as the password’s lifetime and whether MFA is activated; this information would normally be spread out across multiple consoles and hard to follow. \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" title=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUsing this dashboard, you can review users’ access in a timely manner, without missing important information. You can go through users one by one and review the permissions they have, instead of circling through groups and permissions trying to figure out what users inherit based on their group assignment. \n\nAfter configuring your cloud environment and assigning roles and permissions, an IAM dashboard like the one in the image above can help you to identify any gaps left in your cloud user management and should be treated as best practice.  \n\n### Finding and resolving excessive permissions \n\nIdentifying users with excessive permissions can help prevent an attacker from escalating privileges in a cloud environment. You can use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) to assign high privileges for a limited amount of time to users and therefore limit the attack surface.  \n\nFollow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) when configuring users’ roles and permissions to ensure that they do not have access to resources they don’t need to use. \n\nIn the previous section, we looked at an IAM dashboard and identified how many user accounts a single person has. On the right-hand side of the dashboard, we can see a “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" title=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe user ‘John’ has a Contributor role over the second subscription in Azure, revealing a wide range of permissions. This user has full access to manage all resources, meaning he can modify and delete resources. Alarm bells should start ringing here because if this user were to be compromised, the entire Azure environment would be at risk.\n\n### Best practices for identity and access control  \n\nEffective IAM is crucial in today's cloud security landscape. From getting full visibility over assets, people, user accounts and permissions from the start, to good hygiene at every stage of the identity lifecycle, the guidance above will help you establish a strong strategy.  \n\nUse this checklist below to tick off the key elements that can, together with a centralized identity and access management approach, help improve your cloud security: \n\n* Deploy an effective onboarding and role management process \n* Review permissions frequently \n* Enforce a strong password policy \n* Adopt SSO \n* Enforce MFA \n* Achieve full visibility of assets, people and users \n* Apply the Least Privilege Principle \n* Deploy an effective offboarding process \n* Centralize IAM"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"HITRUST (Health Information Trust) Alliance is the organization that established the HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework), a framework for managing and securing information in the healthcare industry.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant: Making Cloud Security More Intuitive","seoTitle":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant | Cyscale","description":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","seoDescription":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","date":"2023-11-02T13:00:05.768Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/blog-cover-ai-assistant.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/41be8/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/c78f7/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/913d0/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/91660/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/888e2/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Cyscale, [the platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily,](https://cyscale.com/) is excited to give a first glimpse into the potential enabled by generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM),  unveiling our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question. \n\nAs engineers we’ve spent almost 20 years working with the cloud, and the complexity of cloud environments mean it’s now impossible to correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually to expose real risk, especially if you have a small team.  \n\nGenerating security alerts is not the problem. The problem is understanding them in context, and it's getting harder for a CTO or CISO to [prioritize remediation because of the volume of alerts](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/).   \n\nWe think context is king, and the value of Cyscale is in our application of graph technology to inventory all cloud assets and the relationships between those assets to [identify and prioritize real security threats](https://cyscale.com/blog/contextual-security-google-cloud/).   \n\nNow with developments in AI we are taking this value even further by enabling our platform to automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues using our customers’ cloud footprint combined with Large Language Models (LLM) of vulnerabilities and exploits.    \n\nIn our first look at Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant you can see how we’re making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\n## D﻿emonstration of Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant\n <br class=\"\" />\n \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/boWgsssdTDI?si=0IfNfAnUTRMWpvf8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe key value here is the democratization of cloud security. Regardless of your skill level, the Security Assistant connects all the dots between disparate information sources so you don’t have to. This means security practitioners struggling to keep up with technical tasks can get information that’s relevant to them, just the same as compliance officers can get information about security posture through a lens that’s more relevant to their interests.  \n\nThis example shows you just the very tip of what’s possible by asking the Assistant questions such as:  \n\n* Which security controls have failed?   \n* What are my top three vulnerabilities and their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score?  \n* How can I fix these vulnerabilities on their specific cloud platform?   \n\n## Democratizing cloud security with AI\n\nNot only does this approach help people in different functions (security, DevOps, compliance) get information that’s more contextually relevant to their role, it helps them perform tasks faster by giving links directly to the affected assets in question, and clear instructions on how to fix associated issues.   \n\nIt also helps security professionals navigate multi-cloud environments by abstracting the unique and different terminologies used from one cloud provider to another (‘termination’ versus ‘deallocation’ for example) into more natural language. \n\n> “Cybersecurity may have become cloud security, but it’s becoming less and less human friendly,” says Ovidiu Cical, Cyscale CEO. “It’s now impossible for a CTO, CISO, or security practitioner to stay on top of an endless list of alerts and things that need fixing without automation. Companies like us have made great strides in automating these processes and providing context but it’s still a lot of information for small teams to digest and act on.” \n>\n> “With these rapid developments in AI assistance we can help different kinds of people interact with our tools in a more natural and contextually relevant way. AI is actually making cloud security more human,” Ovidiu adds.   \n\nThis is important because [Gartner estimates that 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure), mainly through failures to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. Automation puts people back in control by helping them better manage cloud complexity, security, and compliance. \n\nCyscale’s Security Assistant is still in development, so stay tuned for more insights into the potential unlocked by AI, but existing customers and new prospects can request to have it added to their account for testing.  \n\n[B﻿ook a demo to see](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) it in action.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","seoTitle":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures due to failure to disclose significant cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities over at least a two-year period.

Moreover, they have routinely overstated their cybersecurity best practices and misled investors.  \n\nSEC’s complaint seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown”, SolarWinds’ CISO. \n\nSEC’s actions show that cybersecurity should be taken seriously and should include adequate prevention as well as remediation strategies, otherwise companies may face serious legal consequences.  \n\nIt is important to identify ongoing risks and apply effective measures to increase security posture, but also to take an objective and realistic view. The SEC statement reveals that an internal document from SolarWinds’ mentions that “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”  \n\nThis is not an uncommon predicament. Companies frequently find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to security issues and often fail to allocate enough funds and personnel to rectify them. Furthermore, ‘alert fatigue’ is a rapidly growing problem, where security tools generate so many alerts that assessing and fixing them becomes an impossible task.  \n\nThis is one of the key issues Cyscale set out to solve. Through the application of context to each security alert, Cyscale’s mission is to help companies overcome the challenges of slim resources and budgets by prioritizing security issues and guiding professionals to work on the 20% of things that matter and make 80% of the difference.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","seoTitle":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","description":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","seoDescription":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","date":"2023-10-24T11:26:33.738Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cyscale-europas-hottest-cybersecurity-startup","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/cyscale-europas-awards.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg","srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/41be8/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/c78f7/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/913d0/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/91660/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/888e2/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"We are super excited to reveal that Cyscale – the [platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily](https://cyscale.com/) – has made the longlist for The Europas Awards 2023.  \n\n[The Europas,](https://www.theeuropas.com/) founded by Tech Crunch’s Mike Butcher, has been Europe’s most prestigious startup awards program for the last 15 years and has been instrumental in identifying some of the world’s most ambitious and successful startups, including Spotify, Deliveroo, Wise, and Starling Bank among many others.  \n\nCyscale entered the awards along with 400 other European startups and has made the cut in the cybersecurity category against five other entrants.  \n\n“It’s great to see Cyscale acknowledged among the Europas nominees as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security,” said Cyscale CEO Ovidiu Cical.  \n\n“Over 400 startups entered these awards and all of them are building their game-changing applications in the cloud. Some companies are even targeting regulated sectors like fintech, healthtech, and insuretech, where security and compliance are critical factors,” Ovidiu added.  \n\n“While the cloud has become the great enabler for these innovations, it’s also the complexity of the cloud that is killing businesses. There are now more controls and configurations than is humanly possible to keep track of, and one mistake – one misconfiguration or vulnerability in your cloud – can cost you your reputation and your business,” he said.  \n\nCyscale is pioneering the application of cloud security for other startups, scaleups, and SaaS builders by focusing on ease of use and time to value. The CTO or CISO of a startup building out its tech stack doesn’t have the time or the skillset to spend days in every week chasing security alerts.  \n\nSo, Cyscale empowers these companies by not only automatically identifying security problems, but also giving the context needed to prioritize remediation and providing guidance on how to fix issues.  \n\nCyscale is already helping companies secure and monitor their multi-cloud assets and data with our context-driven approach, and we are now looking to harness the power of AI to replace existing security tools with prompts and make an automated and scalable security team available to every cloud-centric company. This recognition by The Europas validates our approach. \n\nGood luck to all the entrants!
