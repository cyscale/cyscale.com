Romania, for example, has earned its title as the ‘Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe’ thanks to the strength of the tech community in Cluj-Napoca, the second largest city in the country.  \n\n## **Public cloud as an enabler and a challenge** \n\nThe public cloud is the key enabler for all these businesses. But while cloud services from AWS, Azure, Google, Alibaba and others are more widely adopted and more secure than ever before, the cloud is an increasingly complex technology to manage, with a multitude of proprietary settings and controls, growing ever more granular. As a result, the greatest challenge to cloud as an enabler exists not in the security of the cloud itself, but in the policies, controls, and workflows for security of the technology.  \n\n## **Cloud security breaches are caused by mistakes and misconfigurations**  \n\nIn nearly all cases of cloud data breach, it is the user, not the cloud provider, who fails to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. In fact, Gartner estimates 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault and there is a wealth of additional research to back this up. \n\nThe simple fact is that humans can no longer correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually because of the sheer volume of alerts and complexity of configurations. The problem of SaaS security is especially pervasive in companies with small security teams, where it’s also especially hard for a CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure to prioritize remediation.   \n\nNot even large, well-resourced companies are exempt, with Microsoft, Twitter, and T-Mobile among the headlines in 2023 for security incidents leading to significant breaches of cloud data.   \n\n## **What makes an effective cloud security strategy?** \n\nIf you’re a SaaS CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure responsible for apps and data at a cloud-native or cloud-first business you need to deploy an effective cloud security strategy from the get-go. We’ve put together this SaaS CTO security checklist to help you understand what you need to do to get cloud security measures right from the start.\n\n## **The SaaS CTO security checklist**\n\nIn this article we look at the *[five key pillars that make up a strong cloud security strategy,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/)* including how to understand your unique cloud environment based on your specific usage of AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or whichever provider you choose.  \n\nYou also need to consider that your cloud environment may not be static, with developers adding and removing assets, and sensitive data being created on a frequent basis. So, this means your cloud security approach can’t be static either, and you will need some kind of continuous monitoring and assessment program to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities along with a regular review of security policies.  \n\nIn this *[guide to cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)* we go into actionable detail that will help you create a roadmap for deployment of your cloud security strategy, covering data security when data is in motion, in use, and at rest, the types of attacks that threaten your data and what you can do to defend against them.  \n\n## **Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure** \n\nA foundational building block for any cloud-native cybersecurity strategy is a thorough understanding of your infrastructure and unique characteristics of your web applications including microservices architectures, virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing, among others. \n\nThis guide looks at how you can *[properly assess your cloud-native infrastructure,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-infrastructure/)* draw conclusions and create an efficient plan for remediation.  \n\nIf you need a *[deeper dive into the cloud-native technology stack,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/)* our explainer looks at the differences between cloud-native, cloud-based, and cloud-enabled approaches.  \n\n## **Understanding CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** \n\nAs adoption of the cloud has grown, so too has the need for specialized tools to secure it. At some point you will have come across the term Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) as an essential part of a cloud security program designed to identify and expose the unintentional risks that can expose your data, or make your code or your infrastructure vulnerable to hackers. \n\n## **What is CSPM?** \n\nCSPM solutions use the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google, to gather rich data on your specific cloud configuration and workloads. These cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\nUnintentional cloud configuration mistakes typically occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility into the organization’s cloud security posture due to too many dashboards, management panels, or controls. This becomes your problem.  \n\nRegardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to a disastrous data breach or leakage. \n\nWe have an *[essential guide to understanding Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/)* for those that need familiarize themselves.   \n\n## **Best practices for CSPM** \n\nIn our *[CSPM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/)* document, we look at how CSPM solutions can be used to ensure visibility of assets; use context to identify and prioritize assets with the greatest risk; ensure compliance with relevant frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST and more); maintain ongoing monitoring of your environment to identify new threats; and finally, direct you to efficient remediation.    \n\n## **What to look for in a CSPM solution** \n\nOur separate guide on *[what to look for in a CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/)* equips you with key questions to ask and considerations to help you make the right choice for your business at your current state of cloud maturity.  \n\nWhile our *[buyer’s guide to cloud security solutions](https://cyscale.com/blog/buyers-guide-cloud-security-solutions/)* goes into even further detail regarding the difference between enterprise-grade solutions, security offerings from your cloud service provider, and the free tools on offer.  \n\n## **Understanding CNAPP** \n\nAnother acronym you may encounter - CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) - refers to a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps and combines multiple functionalities from separate toolsets, including CSPM, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), essentially covering all the bases of identity and access, code, and infrastructure.  \n\nWe have a primer on *[cloud-native applications security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/)* that looks at why and when you may need a CNAPP solution.\n\nB﻿ook a free assessment with Cyscale to use CNAPP capabilities to secure your cloud security posture.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n<div class=\"pb-0 pt-4 lg:pb-0 lg:pt-2 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">Start assessment</button></a></div>\n\n## **Common cloud misconfigurations and how to avoid them** \n\nIn terms of actionable insights, our extensive handbook on *[common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/)* looks at five of the most common cloud misconfigurations SaaS companies encounter, including: storage access configuration, access control, unrestricted network ports for inbound and outbound traffic, encryption oversights, or disabled or misconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\nWorking through this checklist can help you establish best practices for securing your apps and data in the cloud, including the use of tags to help establish security policies across all your relevant assets.  \n\n## **The dangers of alert fatigue** \n\nBy the time you have designed a cloud security strategy and possibly deployed a few tools to help you enforce it, you will begin generating security alerts.  \n\nFalse positive alerts are the bane of any CTO or CISO and with cloud environments becoming so complex, alert fatigue is a very real and growing problem. A constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming, because when everything is important, nothing is important.  \n\n*[Alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/)* is one of the biggest complaints cybersecurity professionals have about the tools they use. As a Cloud Security Manager we spoke to says: \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\"  \n\nSo when it comes to beating alert fatigue, the onus is on the tools you use, and we believe three innovations are essential: \n\nCustom risk rules – Define your own threshold for security posture. What works for one company won’t work for another. \n\nAutomation – With so many assets across so many cloud providers to track, humans cannot keep up. Continuous and automated detection of misconfigurations is critical. \n\nContext - Not all alerts are created equal, and different teams have different responsibilities. Context allows you to immediately prioritize tasks. \n\nWhich brings us to... \n\n## **Incident response planning** \n\nThis is a critical part of any effective cloud security plan, because while an effective security strategy focuses on preventative maintenance, an incident response plan sets out the steps you take when a security breach happens.  \n\n## **Designing an effective incident response plan** \n\nWe have a *[step-by-step checklist in our essential cloud security tips](https://cyscale.com/blog/essential-tips-cloud-security/)* you can use to establish your incident response plan, looking at: \n\n* Determining what caused the incident \n* Containing the incident \n* Notifying affected parties such as customers if customer data is affected\n* Conducting a root cause analysis \n* Implementing remediation measures \n* Learnings and evaluation \n\nAs the threat landscape constantly evolves, so must your cloud security awareness and strategy. Business leaders must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities as well as any changes in their existing environment.  \n\nEven with a good cloud security strategy in place, an effective plan is an adaptive plan, and one that ensures ongoing defense against new threats.\n\nB﻿ook a demo now to find out actionable insights and prepare for cloud security challenges.\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-6 lg:pb-12 lg:pt-6 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["IAM","CSPM","Misconfigurations"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","description":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the first line of defense against attackers in the cloud.

It may not seem like much if a user has read permissions over a storage account, but if that storage account contains sensitive data, such as credentials for another account, then the magnitude of the impact will surpass your initial assessment. \n\nIn this article, I will show you how human mistakes can lead to a complex attack path, where a malicious user gains access to a storage account, compromises a user, and ultimately gains access to a key vault that contains cryptographic keys and secrets used by the company’s apps. \n\nI’ve chosen a scenario where gross mistakes are made to highlight that you should not underestimate human error and the blast radius it can have.  \n\n## Case Study\n\nFintech Inc. is a financial technology startup developing a new banking application. A few customers already use the new app to access their banking data in real-time and manage their accounts. Fintech Inc. uses Microsoft Azure to develop and host their app. \n\nThe company must invite an external consultant, Anita, to collaborate in the cloud. Any user is allowed by default to invite guests in Microsoft Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory), so John, a member of the IT department, invites Anita as a guest. \n\nHowever, he makes a mistake; because he’s trying to accomplish many things in a short period of time, instead of inviting anita@fintechinc.com, he invites anita@fintech.com. The new guest user accepts the invitation and becomes a guest in Microsoft Entra ID. \n\nAs a guest, the \"fake\" Anita cannot do much. She can only access some resources that guests can access, she can manage her profile and collaborate with other users in Office 365 apps.  \n\nBut, looking closely, she discovers that she is now part of the ITAdmins group. How did that happen?! On a closer look, ITAdmins has a dynamic membership rule that states that all users whose department is \"IT\" become part of the group. The IT department wanted to make things easy for them and allow all employees in IT to join this group automatically. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-dynamic-membership-rule.png\" alt=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" title=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, this rule is very broad and opens up the possibility for mistakes. In this case, Anita was assigned the “IT” department, and she immediately joined the ITAdmins group, since Azure checks the attributes for a user whenever they are changed or a new user joins the cloud.  \n\nUpon further investigation, Anita discovers that the ITAdmins group has a very highly privileged role over the “rg-management\" resource group – the Contributor role. This role allows Anita to view, modify, and delete any resources within the resource group. Here comes the importance of the Least Privilege Principle – granting users too many permissions can do more harm than good. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-it-admins-contributor-rg-management.png\" alt=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" title=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we take a look at this resource group, we will see it contains an interesting storage account – “backups”, a database, and a VM. \n\nWe can see this relation in the graph below. Tracing the attack path, we immediately realize how Anita is able to access the cloud assets, from the rg-management resource group through the new role she gained by joining ITAdmins, and therefore compromise them. By looking at context in the cloud, we become aware of the risk imposed by the ITAdmins groups, which has broad permissions over a multitude of important resources. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-first-graph.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the attack path\" title=\"Graph showing the attack path\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe storage account has a \"backups\" container with a \"diskBackup.vhd\" file inside. This contains the files and data an ex-employee used before leaving the company. While in a rush, an IT admin has decided to back up the disk and look at it at some other time, later forgetting about it. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-backups-container.png\" alt=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" title=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUpon restoring this file as a computer disk, Anita discovers a set of credentials. She knows she should not log in using those credentials, but she does it anyway – after all, this is not the first questionable action she’s done -, because she is curious.  \n\nThe set of credentials – an email and a password – are for a test user that was created in the past to test features of the application, the removal of which was forgotten. The user cannot log in to the portal due to a Conditional Access policy that denies access to the Microsoft Azure Management resource (Portal included).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-access-to-portal-denied.png\" alt=\"Portal access denied for user\" title=\"Portal access denied for user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nFortunately, Anita can still log in using the credentials – through the CLI. This is a common \"bypass\" of this barrier, and, fortunately, she's good with command lines, so she can investigate what permissions her new user has. \n\nShe checks her new role assignments in the current subscription using the commandlet *Get-AzRoleAssignment* only to find, among other roles, that she’s a Key Vault Administrator. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-key-vault-administrator-role.png\" alt=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" title=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the Key Vault Administrator role, Anita can [perform all data plane operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) on the Credentials2 key vault that we can see in the image above, and all objects in it. \n\nA key vault is a huge discovery for Anita, who can investigate further. Using the commandlet *Get-AzKeyVaultSecret*, Anita can see that there are a few keys and secrets in the key vault. She can now read them, delete them or add new versions of those secrets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-contents-of-the-key-vault.png\" alt=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" title=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-second-graph.png\" alt=\"The attack path for the new user\" title=\"The attack path for the new user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nAnita can now further discover other assets available on Fintech Inc.’s Azure cloud environment and possibly make use of the secrets stored in the “Credentials2” Key Vault. For example, we know that, as a best practice, [databases are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/), so a leaked decryption cryptographic key, for example, can lead to total compromise of the company’s data. \n\nTo understand everything that happened here, we need to look at all the bad practices and vulnerabilities that we have uncovered, in chronological order: \n\n1. Due to being in a rush, an employee invited the wrong person to collaborate in Azure, and no one picked up on it. \n2. The dynamic membership rule for the ITAdmins group is very broad and may accept unintended cases. \n3. The ITAdmins group has a highly privileged role over a resource group with many resources that may contain sensitive information, such as databases, and storage accounts. \n4. A disk backup that can be restored is held unencrypted in a storage account, containing a cleartext password for an active Azure account. \n5. A test user that was intended to be temporary is still active. \n6. A test user has access to a very high-value resource. \n\nAs you can see, each mistake allowed the intruder to advance more and more and compromise additional resources. \n\nThis is why contextual security and proper IAM security are necessary. Contextual security allows cloud professionals to understand what assets are impacted by others, while IAM best practices protect the cloud environment from intruders and represent the first barrier of entry.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups    ","seoTitle":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups | Cyscale ","description":"This essential guide for startups looks at the pros and cons of enterprise-grade, free, and cloud providers' own security solutions.

From your intellectual property and software services you sell, to sensitive data on customers and users, any threat can put your reputation on the line.  \n\nWhile public cloud resources are key enablers of business, they come with the adoption of a shared responsibility model that makes it difficult to define your security perimeter. This makes securing your apps and data in the cloud a complex and confusing process. But it doesn’t have to be. Good cloud security is achievable for any business, regardless of size, and it shouldn’t take all your time and resources to get it right.  \n\n### Context is king \n\nHow many cloud resources or assets am I running? What even is a cloud resource? My engineers are creating new assets every week, how am I going to keep track of them all? Where does the responsibility of AWS end and mine begin? These are the kind of questions you are going to be faced with, whether cloud security is your full-time job or just part of your responsibility for the overall tech stack.  \n\nFinding answers to these questions and more, will take time and effort because there are no standard responses. Everyone’s cloud infrastructure is different and brings with it unique risks.  \n\nThis is why context is so important. Cybersecurity tools are notorious for creating alert fatigue – an overwhelming number of alerts for every vulnerability, misconfiguration, and new threat out there. Following up on all these alerts as and when they come in, can easily start out as a fool’s errand and frequently become humanly impossible.  \n\nFor example: An unsecured Virtual Machine in isolation may pose no risk but will still trigger an alert. An unsecured VM that has access to a bucket used to store sensitive client data poses a much bigger risk that your company, your customers, and your lawyers will care about.  \n\n**Identify** \n\nBeing able to identify the risks is only one part of the challenge.   \n\n**Prioritize** \n\nUnderstanding the context of the risk to prioritize it is an essential second stage in the process. \n\n**Fix** \n\nThe steps needed to remediate the risk are the third stage in the solution. \n\nBecause there is no one-size-fits-all solution to cloud infrastructure security, any attempt to follow this path will eventually result in frustration due to not feeling in control, and a lack of understanding of the impact of a security issue, which can lead to bigger threats.  \n\n### My cloud provider has its own security tools, can’t I just use them? \n\nAll the big cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer a suite of security tools specific to their products and these are a common choice for cloud native organizations as they can be added on when buying cloud services and are built by the same provider.  \n\nBut these solutions have evolved in line with the sprawling menu of cloud services on offer, and the application of these tools has become granular to the level where some security components and their corresponding configuration are attached to specific products and services, and then again to specific regions and resources.  \n\nThe cloud providers charge for security services in much the same way they do for cloud resources. Not only does this frequently trigger the ‘bill shock’ associated with cloud consumption, because activating a native security solution for a service introduces unpredictability into the pricing, it makes management of your cloud security posture very complex and time consuming.  \n\nThis approach has significant implications for context as well – because information is scattered within the toolset, you are required to make the relevant correlations yourself, resulting in poor overall visibility and blind spots.  \n\nFurthermore, this is just for a single cloud environment. If your organization needs to secure apps or data across multiple clouds, you need to learn a whole other set of security services and tools specific to the cloud environment.  \n\nSo, if you use the AWS supplied toolset, you must go to 1,000 different places to understand all your security settings, let alone how all the security settings relate and connect to one another. And when you go to Azure, it's another 1,000 places that you go to check. \n\nOf course, some companies will become proficient in using the cloud provider’s own security tools, but there is still the associated cost in deployment and the investment into a non-transferrable skill. This can result in cloud security know-how being concentrated within certain people and makes it difficult to understand your broader posture from both a cloud security and compliance perspective.  \n\n### What about the big-name cloud security solutions I read about in a Gartner report? \n\nThere are well-established vendors, like Check Point, that have developed their portfolios over time, and there are relative newcomers to cloud security, like Orca and Wiz, that have picked up big name customers and you would be wise to assess these offerings.  \n\nHowever, most of these solutions are targeted at enterprise customers with big teams and big budgets, and even the analysts note that some of the most comprehensive security solutions are not suitable for smaller organizations due to the investment required in skills, deployment, and management, not to mention the overall cost.  \n\nFor even the most experienced of users, heavyweight solutions can become overwhelming, resulting in a counter-effective approach as users lose control of their security posture.  \n\n### But there are free tools I can use \n\nThe cloud security landscape is very competitive and there are a range of tools available that claim to be completely free. But anyone making security tools for cloud infrastructure knows that cybersecurity is not something you can cut costs on, so these tools will not remain free, except perhaps for the smallest organizations.  \n\nMost of the free tools are limited in scope or capability requiring a paid ‘upgrade’ to unlock. Others are designed to be self-installed at the free level – a challenge in itself – while the as-a-service version comes with a price tag.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for, and solutions that have no investment in their development are unlikely to offer the level of service and support you get from a paid solution. These tools will quickly become frustrating due to a shortfall in features and an overreliance on multiple offerings to achieve an inferior result.  \n\nCyscale itself offers a free trial of the full product with no limitations, as well as onboarding support to ensure you will get the most value out of our solution before you buy.  \n\n### How do I address cloud infrastructure compliance? \n\nEnabled by the agility of cloud computing, many companies launch SaaS products into the market without fully understanding the regulatory climate, then realize they need to show compliance.   \n\nWith an infrastructure that changes on a weekly or even daily basis as engineers spin up new VMs and resources, preparing for an audit can be stressful, especially in regulated environments where you have to check your security posture against frameworks such as CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST, or many others. \n\nFurther challenges can arise in organizations where engineers have adopted a cloud provider’s own security tools, as these products are notoriously difficult to get visibility into whether established policies are being followed in implementations, leaving you blind to security drifts.   \n\nAt the end of the day, compliance should be delivered as a byproduct of good security, and your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) approach should ensure you are able to see compliance with regulatory frameworks and policies without the need to manually correlate reports from multiple applications.  \n\n### Identity, Access, and Entitlements \n\nOne of the biggest challenges when building applications in the cloud is identity, access, and entitlements, sometimes referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM). This refers to all the best practices and rules that must be followed when establishing authentication and authorization for a user to an organization’s systems and applications, because while keeping track of who has access to what sounds simple, it’s something that is really difficult to do in the cloud. \n\nMoreover, access is not restricted to human users; applications and other types of identities also require access to different types of resources.  \n\nOf course, the big cloud providers each have their own unique approach to access management, and this means learning approaches specific to each cloud environment. Some cloud security solutions integrate with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and help you manage identities and access form a central location, improving your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\n### Understanding the cloud infrastructure security landscape \n\n**Glossary** \n\n[CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management) \n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions are designed specifically for cloud environments, using the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers to gather rich data on cloud configuration and workloads. Cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\n[Misconfiguration](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) \n\nAn incorrect configuration of a cloud system that may lead to vulnerabilities. Possible misconfigurations are too many to list but may include making sensitive databases publicly accessible, creating identities with access rights more elevated than required, enabling write access on a resource that should be read only.  \n\n[Vulnerability](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) \n\nA vulnerability is an inherent weakness in a cloud system that means a resource is unable to resist the actions of a threat agent. A vulnerability could be created through a misconfiguration, or series of misconfigurations, but it could also be a newly discovered flaw in a piece of code or software that a resource is dependent on.  \n\nThreat \n\nA cloud threat is a type of attack or adversary looking to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in data breaches, data loss, system hijacking, and a myriad of other internal and external threats.  \n\nResource \n\nA cloud resource, also known as an asset, refers to any one of a number of entities including but not limited to, a virtual machine, a database, or storage bucket. An asset could also refer to VPC, subnet, policy, security key, or IP address. \n\n[CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) \n\nA CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps. A cloud-native application is an application that is designed for, run and hosted in the cloud.  \n\nCIEM \n\nCIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) tools manage identities and access privileges to cloud infrastructure and services. It is often deployed as an umbrella solution that includes Identity and Access Management (IAM). \n\n**Download this guide as a PDF** \n\n<div class=\"hs-cta-embed hs-cta-simple-placeholder hs-cta-embed-136438852760\" style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;width:210px;height:42.390625px\" data-hubspot-wrapper-cta-id=\"136438852760\"><a href=\"https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKTGbp%2Fo9uY%2B1cpwqxYO%2BVdgBMG2bgcgDZpv3UP7fDM0cPci8FmFfQrFEsURZY%2FBCwYOLNlG1XYE6BnbA1HIeTHNfwLiP2GUGYlTRO8CW82qb9egx0YmY9aQqHwOJa6iekClG%2FMfqEbCu0Dp5wkLzxfl7v4ITdglHTHc9cfvbVS11AWnEbx0NEGVzaWJngIJAT7AL7Hb9Sj8j%2BtDc7O96NDo4C5OsZhIeDO7CXDRRccKrDRsTFtfE9f4VAPVJWvV65oHjHpAVfzD5qX8u%2BU%2FIVvOMducO6AS96ZUM4%3D&webInteractiveContentId=136438852760&portalId=5413427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><img alt=\"Download\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5413427/interactive-136438852760.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: fill\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"/></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","IAM","Misconfigurations"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","description":"The future of cloud security is contextual security.

And although companies were reluctant to put their infrastructure and applications in the hands of a different company, cloud solutions have grown in popularity.  \n\nWith more and more complex setups, it is hard for an organization to understand and keep track of the implication of every resource they have in the cloud, the risk it poses to the entire infrastructure or how many other assets it impacts. \n\nI believe the future of cloud security is contextual security. To fully understand how secure an asset is, you need to understand what users have permissions to interact with it and what resources it communicates with. It might seem that a VM is completely secure because you put it behind a firewall, but if a compromised user can access it, it’s game over. \n\nThe perfect recipe for contextual security is a [Cloud Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/). Based on it, we can represent in a visual and interactive way how cloud resources interact, what kind of relations they have, what users have permissions to read/write on them, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate my point, I will show you some scenarios where the difference between a secure cloud and a breach is made by fixing misconfigurations and limiting users' access. These measures are easier to identify using a graph, because it helps you understand the risks your environment is exposed to.  \n\n## Case Study \n\nLet’s assume we use BigQuery in Google Cloud for a health analytics application. We have a table that contains some datasets of patients from a hospital, including PII data. These datasets are very valuable and cannot fall in the hands of outsiders. \n\nNow, we want to make sure that the data is securely stored. We look at the BigQuery table’s graph to see if the table poses any risk and, low and behold, it does! \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-graf0.png\" alt=\"Contextual security through the graph\" title=\"Contextual security through the graph\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe can observe, in the image above, that no less than 7 Cloud Functions and 4 VMs can access it across 9 Service Accounts that have permissions on the BigQueryTable, as well as 7 IAM Users. Does this alarm you? It should. \n\nBut just because a VM, or a function, can have access to the table does not mean anything, right? Wrong! I’m going to show you exactly how bad things can get in this situation. I’m going to put my hacker shoes on and show you potential scenarios that might lead to data being stolen. \n\n### Scenario 1: compromised VM \n\nOut of the 4 VMs that we see in the image, one is an Internet-facing one. The compute instance “dev-1” hosts an application that has the Log4J vulnerability, a classic. A hacker leverages the vulnerability and gains access to the instance. If they take over an IAMUser with the Compute Instance Admin role, or obtain SSH access to the VM, the disaster begins. **Because a Service Account is associated to the VM, the attacker has that account’s permissions.** In our scenario, the application running on the Instance needs to process data in the dataset, so the associated Service Account was given the roles/bigquery.dataEditor permission. \n\nMoreover, in a VM, credentials used to manually authenticate are stored on the Compute Instance after the first time a user authenticates as a Service Account, in */.config/gcloud/credentials.db*, as you can see in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss1.png\" alt=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" title=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThis is a standard location and it stores the last private key that was used to authenticate as a Service Account.  You can also find access tokens in the same folder, in *access_tokens.db*. Moreover, you can see any other private keys used previously (which may still be valid, if they were not deleted in the Google Cloud Console) in */.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/<serviceAccountEmail>/adc.json*. \n\nLooking at the file credentials.db, we notice that the information is not stored in the standard format for a private key for a Service Account. With a few adjustments, we obtain a valid private key that we then use to authenticate. To authenticate as a Service Account with a private key, simply use the following command:  \n\n```\ngcloud auth activate-service-account <serviceAccountEmail> --key-file=<keyFile>\n```\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss2.png\" alt=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" title=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, what happens when no one has authenticated as a Service Account on the VM? There is no *credentials.db* file (actually, there is no *.config* folder).  \n\nDevelopers tend to find ways to do things faster, and they get comfortable. It is not uncommon to find secrets in environment variables or plain-text files. If a developer were to store a secret key file on the Compute Instance, we could abuse it. Simply log in using the private RSA key file: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss3.png\" alt=\"Private key on the VM\" title=\"Private key on the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss4.png\" alt=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" title=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nChecking the current permissions, and… bingo! roles/bigquery.dataEditor is one of the available roles. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss5.png\" alt=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" title=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we expand the graph’s nodes that we used in this chain of attacks, you can clearly see the attack path: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-primul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through the VM\" title=\"Attack path through the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the bigquery.dataEditor role, the attacker can now: \n\n* view data and metadata, \n* modify data and metadata, \n* delete tables. \n\n This breach could be avoided by: \n\n* ensuring the VM does not have vulnerabilities, and patching the Log4J one, \n* isolating the Compute Instance from the Internet by closing the exposed port, if possible, \n* restricting the Service Account’s permissions as much as possible,\n* making sure secrets are cleared from the VM files.   \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss6.png\" alt=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" title=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### Scenario 2: compromised user \n\nExpanding the Users node, we see that there are three users that have access to the BigQueryTable.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ultimul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through user compromise\" title=\"Attack path through user compromise\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf a hacker were to take over any of those accounts, for example, by stealing credentials, our customer’s data would be at risk. If one of the three users that have access to the table does not have MFA enforced, then the attacker can compromise the account.  \n\nEnabling MFA would prevent this. \n\nBesides this, a common mistake is focusing on protecting your environment from the outside, and forgetting about your own users. If one of the employees in the organization has too many permissions, they may produce damage without intention. By exploring the account and looking at resources, a user can accidentally modify or delete an asset. \n\nThis is why the Least Privilege Principle is so important – always limit the users’ access as much as possible and only assign the necessary permissions. \n\nWe believe that context is the future of cloud security. We’ve seen how the most simple relations between assets can be leveraged by attackers to take over cloud assets; and if your customers’ data is stored in those assets, the greater the prize is for hackers – and they will do anything to get it."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","description":"The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) of the Department of Homeland Security is now embarking on its third cyber vulnerability review since the body was created in February 2022.

During August, when lots of people were on summer vacation, a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory was exposed.  \n\nAs with the two vulnerabilities the CSRB reviewed previously - Log4J in July of 2022 and Lapsus$ also in August of 2023 – the Azure Active Directory vulnerability highlights significant challenges in terms of remediation, due to the sprawling nature of cloud resources and their direct and indirect dependencies on assets that might, or might not, be affected.  \n\nEven for large organizations with sizeable security teams, navigating a complex dependency graph to understand which resources have dependencies on affected assets is a challenge. For SaaS startups with perhaps a handful of people building out their technology stack, such investigations are impossible.  \n\nAs a result, the findings of the CSRB’s reports and its recommendations for best practice build a strong case for contextually aware cloud security practices.  \n\n## How does this affect you (and everyone else)? \n\nIn its most recent announcement, the CSRB made it clear that identity access management (IAM) and authentication are in focus due to being one of the most vulnerable areas in a cloud environment. Identity management vulnerabilities are a key entry point for hackers, and SaaS companies and large enterprises are falling victim repeatedly. From IAM misconfigurations that CTOs and developers miss when setting up and managing their environment, to cloud service provider bugs, this area needs critical attention to ensure safe and secure cloud environments. \n\n## Did I just say cloud service provider bugs?  \n\nYes, I did. The incident in question that kicked off this latest review less than two months ago, was the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory (soon to be renamed Microsoft Entra ID) that was allowing hackers to fabricate authentication tokens. Around 25 organizations including US government entities were impacted by this bug before it was discovered, with attackers stealing mailbox data and obtaining access to sensitive emails.  \n\nFor cloud native organizations building their entire business on public cloud platforms, this shared responsibility model is one of the most misunderstood (or ignored) aspects.  \n\nWhen the terms & conditions say that the cloud is a ‘shared responsibility’, it really is. It’s the cloud service provider’s job to secure the platform or infrastructure, and your job to secure the apps and data, and if one party fails (in this case, the cloud service provider – Microsoft Azure), your company, and potentially your customers and partners, are left exposed. \n\nThe CSRB’s previous two reports on [Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/csrb-log4j-key-findings-and-recommendations-summary) and [Lapsus$](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/review-attacks-associated-lapsus-and-related-threat-groups-executive-summary) have been very thorough and made some great recommendations that we hope will advance cybersecurity practices, which is why we’re eagerly waiting for CSRB’s report on cloud security. It not only promises a thorough set of recommendations for CISOs, CTOs, and developers, but it will also sound the alarm for cloud service providers.  \n\nAlthough the Cyber Safety Review Board has no regulatory power, its findings are transmitted to US President Biden and used to develop Executive Orders, so we can expect to see its influence in regulations such as [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), and perhaps best practices adopted into SOC 2, ISO 27001, and others. \n\n## The importance of contextual security \n\nWhat’s become evident is that simply informing businesses and cloud providers of the discovery of far-reaching misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is not enough. In fact, the potential workload created by responding to these challenges can be just as dangerous in that it can consume all an organization’s security resources.  \n\nContext is important and [contextual security](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) is the most significant development in cloud infrastructure security in recent years. Identifying that a VM has the Log4J vulnerability is not the same as saying that an Internet-facing VM has the same vulnerability. Of course, they are both just as vulnerable, but if the first VM is running in a private network, the severity is not as high as for the one accessible from the Internet.

Whether you are a seasoned cloud engineer or a business decision-maker this shift by one of the world's leading cloud providers will likely have broad implications.\n\nAWS's decision aligns with other major cloud providers that have adopted similar practices, reflecting an industry-wide trend. AWS's involvement is particularly significant given its substantial market presence, and it will likely influence various organizations across different scales and industries.\n\nIn terms of your business and the tech landscape, this change goes beyond additional costs, with the new model affecting network planning, igniting considerations about transitioning to IPv6, and opening opportunities to reassess cloud security strategies.\n\n## The Financial Implications of AWS's New Charging Model for IPv4 Addresses\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Pricing\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"/img/aws-ip-cost.png\" alt=\"AWS IP Costs after February 1 2024\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nStarting February 1, 2024, AWS will charge for all public IPv4 addresses at a rate of 0.5 cents per hour. While this figure may initially seem inconsequential, it is vital to understand how swiftly it can accumulate. \n\nFor small businesses or individual projects, the impact might be marginal. Our example considers a small organization with 10 public IP addresses:\n\n*10 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $36.5 per month, or $438 per year.*\n\nContrast this with an enterprise operating with 11,000 public IPs: \n\n*11,000 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $40,150 per month, or nearly **$500,000 per year**.*\n\n1﻿1,000 IP addresses might sound like an overestimation, but we are seeing organizations with tens of thousands of EC2 instances. Assuming 20-30% of these need public IPs is not out of reach.\n\nThis striking difference highlights the importance of understanding and planning for the financial consequences, particularly for organizations heavily reliant on public IPv4 addresses.\n\n### Budget Considerations for Organizations\n\nAWS's decision to charge for public IPv4 addresses extends beyond a simple financial concern; it prompts businesses to reevaluate their entire approach to IP address utilization. Key considerations include:\n\n* **Reviewing existing usage:** Analyzing current usage patterns is essential for predicting additional costs and identifying opportunities for optimization.\n* **Considering IPv6 migration:** Some may find transitioning to IPv6 a cost-effective alternative, though it must be balanced against compatibility and technical constraints.\n* **Utilizing tools and insights:** Automated security platforms like Cyscale can offer comprehensive insights into your inventory of public IP addresses, helping you understand the big picture and delivering insight that can aid in cost control.\n\nThis policy change serves as a catalyst for reimagining how organizations approach cloud infrastructure financially. The ripple effects will be felt differently across the spectrum, but the core message is clear: understanding, planning, and adapting will be pivotal in navigating this change without unforeseen financial setbacks.\n\nWhether you are a decision-maker concerned about the bottom line or a cloud professional tasked with optimization, these changes necessitate close scrutiny and proactive planning.\n\n## Technical Aspects and Considerations\n\n### Impact on EC2 Instances, RDS, EKS, etc.\n\nThe new charging model impacts a broad array of resources, including EC2 instances, RDS, EKS, load balancers, and more. Managing complex architectures now entails a new layer of complexity, possibly requiring a reassessment of networking strategies and configurations.\n\n### The Complexity of Managing Multiple IP Addresses per Resource\n\nSome resources may have more than one public IPv4 address. Managing these involves not just technical configuration but also financial planning. Understanding how these multiple IPs interact within your infrastructure and contribute to overall costs is essential. \n\n### Discussion on the Feasibility and Challenges of Switching to IPv6\n\nThe move to IPv6 seems logical, but it's not devoid of challenges. Compatibility with services and APIs managed by others might become a hurdle. AWS has made progress, such as enabling communication from EC2 to Lambda functions over IPv6 (note that you cannot reach an EC2 instance from Lambda over IPv6), yet some cases may still hinder a complete switch.\n\n### IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms\n\nDuring the transition, Network Address Translation (NAT), specifically NAT64, becomes vital. This mechanism translates IPv6 to IPv4 addresses, bridging communication between newer IPv6 systems and legacy IPv4 systems. Understanding and utilizing NAT64 is crucial for modernizing without losing functionality. Equally important is DNS64 which performs the translation at the DNS level. More specifically, in the case a domain is mapped only to an IPv4 address (i.e., it only has A records), DNS64 translates an A record (specific to IPv4) to an AAAA record (specific to IPv6), thus allowing an IPv6 client to reach an IPv4 server.\n\n### Proficiency with Security Groups and Other Network Considerations\n\nWith all IPv6 addresses being public, mastering security groups and leveraging egress-only internet gateways become even more critical. Properly configuring security rules and comprehending their interaction with different IP versions plays a significant role in upholding security and functionality within your network.\n\nThe new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a financial consideration. It intertwines with a multifaceted web of technical aspects that must be thoughtfully navigated. Embracing the right strategies and tools can pave the way for a seamless transition, preserving both efficiency and budget.\n\n## Security Implications\n\n### Reevaluation of Network Exposure\n\nThe new charges for public IPv4 addresses might encourage organizations to scrutinize network exposure more closely. Reducing the number of public IPs could be both a cost-saving measure and a strategy to enhance security by limiting the **attack surface.**\n\n### Importance of Secure Configuration in IPv6 Transition\n\nTransitioning to IPv6, while potentially cost-effective, demands careful consideration of security configurations. Understanding IPv6 security nuances is vital in safeguarding systems during and after the shift. While NAT64 facilitates communication between IPv6 and IPv4 systems, it also introduces unique security considerations. Proper implementation and continuous vigilance are required to ward off vulnerabilities that might arise during the translation process. In practice, most organizations will leverage the AWS NAT Gateway which already supports NAT64 and DNS64 (through Route 53) so our responsibility includes proper route configuration and keeping DNS resolvers up to date. However, other organizations might choose to deploy their own NAT instance to optimize cost.\n\n### Tools and Platforms for Security Management\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale can play a pivotal role in this secure transition. By providing insights into all public IP addresses, their attachments, and alternative communication paths, they can facilitate a more secure and cost-effective migration. Utilizing specialized security platforms and tools is fundamental to maintaining control over complex cloud environments.\n\nThis new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a technical and financial hurdle; it's an opportunity to rethink and potentially enhance security strategies. By understanding the interplay between IPv4 and IPv6, the role of the transition mechanisms, and the necessity of proper security configurations, organizations can navigate this transition without compromising security.\n\n## The Role of Cloud Security Platforms\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale are more than just a reactive measure to changes like AWS's new charging model for public IPv4 addresses; they represent a proactive approach to modern cloud infrastructure management. By providing tools that cut across cost optimization, security enhancement, migration planning, and collaboration, these holistic solutions enable organizations to thrive in an evolving cloud landscape."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM and Other Features You Never Knew Existed ","seoTitle":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM","description":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","seoDescription":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","date":"2023-08-23T15:16:04.584Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/41be8/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/c78f7/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/913d0/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/91660/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/888e2/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"While assessing the controls suggested by the CIS Benchmark 2.0.0 for Google Cloud, I stumbled upon an interesting recommendation: to launch compute instances with Shielded VM enabled. When you think of VM security, you think of open management ports, outdated OS versions, unencrypted VM disks and so on. So what is Shielded VM and why do you need to enable it ASAP? \n\n\n\n## Shielded VM \n\nShielded VM, in a cloud computing context, is a security solution that hardens VMs deployed in Google Cloud. This measure protects them against rootkits and bootkits, which are essentially malware that infect and obtain persistence in VMs, allowing attackers to infiltrate in the cloud environment through the Compute Instances. It’s like a magical portal into your entire cloud infrastructure, which, if created, opens on command for the hackers.    \n\nThe advantage of this setting is that, with just a few clicks, you significantly increase the protection of your [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) VM by providing it with: \n\n* Secure Boot, \n* vTPM, \n* Integrity monitoring. \n\n**Secure Boot** is a feature that verifies the digital signature of all boot components of a virtual machine. In this way, if any signature verification fails, that boot process is halted, thus ensuring that only authentic software is run on the system. This means that you cannot use any custom drivers on the machine, because if you do, it will cause the VM to not boot anymore. If a failure occurs, the user receives two errors:\n\n* **UEFI: Failed to load image**, and \n* **Status: Security Violation.** \n\n**vTPM, or Virtual Trusted Platform Module,** is a computer chip specialized in protecting secrets. To understand what vTPM is, let’s break it down. TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a hardware component that stores cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive data securely. By virtualizing it, the same result is achieved, but on a software level, meaning that VMs in the cloud can also be protected using a TPM, even though at hardware-level they may share components with other VMs. \n\nvTPM also introduces **Measure Boot**, a mechanism that checks the integrity of the VM’s components. When the VM first boots, Measure Boot establishes an **integrity policy** baseline by calculating hashes of the components, concatenating them and rehashing them into a final hash to guarantee a sound integrity monitoring. Then, every time the VM boots up, the hash is recalculated and checked against the initial one, thus being able to tell if there are any changes in the boot process. \n\nThe integrity policy baseline needs to be updated if changes appear, such as a system update. \n\nThrough the process described, **integrity monitoring** is achieved using Shielded VM and the Measure Boot mechanism. \n\n\n\n### How to enable Shielded VM \n\nTo enable Shielded VM, you can do it through the Google Cloud console, or using the Cloud shell.  \n\n**Using the Google Cloud console** \n\n1. Log in to your Google Cloud console and navigate to Compute Instances (or click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)). \n2. For each VM on which you want to enable the feature, follow these steps: \n\n   1. Click on the VM name to go to its details page.\n   2. On the upper right area of the page, select EDIT. \n   3. Scroll down to “Security and access” and check boxes accordingly to your desired settings. Please note that you cannot select “Integrity Monitoring” without checking “Turn on vTPM”, as Integrity monitoring is a feature provided by vTPM. \n\n**Using the Cloud shell** \n\n1. Stop the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances stop <instanceName>`\n\n2. Turn on vTPM and Integrity Monitoring: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vtpm --shieldedvm-integrity-monitoring`\n\n3. To also turn on Secure Boot (if you have no custom or unsigned drivers on the instance), add the *\\--shielded-vm-secure-boot* parameter to the previous command or execute the following command separately: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vm-secure-boot` \n\n4. After applying the changes, restart the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances start <instanceName>`\n\nNote that Shielded VM is not enabled by default on a VM. However, you can set an organizational policy that will cause all the future VMs to have Shielded VM enabled. To do that, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm).  \n\n\n\n#### Other configurations that you should consider for your Google Cloud VMs \n\nThere are some settings you should always check when assessing the security of a virtual machine. Here are just a few examples: \n\n* Use **confidential computing** to [encrypt in-use data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this way, your data that is processed, trained on, used, queried on your VMs remains encrypted and is not at risk. \n* **Close management ports** if not needed: RDP (3389), SSH (21), WINRM (5985), these are all open gateways for hackers to intrude in your VMs and further down your cloud environment. \n* **Apply patches, OS updates** and any other available updates on your VMs to keep them up to date with the current versions of software and ensure that you’re not leaving them vulnerable to found exploits. \n* **Do not use public IP addresses** for your Compute instances, if possible. Public IP addresses introduce the same vulnerability in your environment as management ports: you increase your attack surface and expose the VM to the Internet. Instead, use load balancers to “hide” your VMs. \n\nAlthough there are many aspects you should consider when setting up your cloud [infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) securely, use this article as a checklist to tick off some of the most important security configurations."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"What’s new: Major updates for Cyscale Automated Cloud Security Platform","seoTitle":"What’s new: Major updates for Cyscale Automated Cloud Security Platform","description":"In the newest major update, Cyscale has added to the Cloud Security Platform scopes, asset security score, enhanced graphs, improved alerts, integration with AWS inspector, more controls, improved compliance reports, and many others.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in [multi-cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).
