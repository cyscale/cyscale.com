It builds upon the NIS 1 Directive, which regulates network and information systems security. NIS2 was created by the European Union to enforce a modern cybersecurity strategy, having in mind new sectors and improving incident response and resilience in compliant entities. NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) came into effect on the 16th of January 2023 and replaces NIS1, which was released in 2016. \n\n## Differences between NIS 1 and NIS 2 \n\nAiming to improve the NIS1 Directive, its newer version has a few differences. Some of the key ones are: \n\n* NIS2 now covers more sectors than NIS1, which focused on essential services operators in sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare. NIS2 also has cloud computing services in scope. Some examples of the newly added sectors are postal and courier services, waste management, digital providers. \n* Security controls are more stringent for NIS2. A few topics covered for the cloud are data encryption, IAM, vulnerability management, zero trust principles, and incident response. \n* Penalties no longer differ from country to country like they did in NIS1; they are harmonized across the European Union. \n\n## Key elements of NIS2 \n\nAll entities in scope should take measures to cover the most important elements, considered by NIS2 as the baseline for protecting the network, information systems, and physical environment from cybersecurity incidents. The following are the mandatory measures: \n\n* Policies on risk analysis and information system security, \n* Incident handling, \n* Business continuity, \n* Supply chain security, \n* Security in network and information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance, \n* Policies to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures, \n* Basic cyber hygiene practices and training, \n* Policies regarding the use of cryptography and encryption, \n* HR security, access control policies, access management, \n* The use of MFA or continuous authentication solutions. \n\nYou can find more details about these requirements directly from [the NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). \n\nThe NIS2 is crucial for implementing cybersecurity best practices and protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations can mitigate risks and contribute to a safer digital environment by adopting the mentioned requirements.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Meet NIS 2 compliance with Cyscale<span id=\"font-gradient\">Unified Cloud Security</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                See Demo\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Timeline and Deadlines\n\n* By **17 July 2024**, The European cyber crisis liaison organisation network (*EU-CyCLONe*) is required to submit its first report to the European Parliament and the Council, assessing its work.

Participation in peer reviews is voluntary and will be carried out by cybersecurity experts designated by at least two Member States.\n    \n* By **17 April 2025**, Member States are required to establish a list of essential and important entities, as well as entities providing domain name registration services. This list will be reviewed and updated regularly, at least *every two years*.\n    \n* By the same date, **17 April 2025**, and every two years thereafter, the competent authorities will notify the Commission and the Cooperation Group of the number of essential and important entities for each sector.\n    \n* The first review of the functioning of this Directive by the Commission will take place by **17 October 2027**, and subsequently *every 36 months*, with a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n## F﻿AQ on NIS2 Directive\n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What is the goal of the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">It aims to enhance cybersecurity resilience for the EU's critical infrastructure and digital service providers.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Who does the NIS2 Directive apply to?</p><p class=\"answer\">It applies to entities that provide essential or important services to the European economy from different sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, finance, but not limited to those.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How does the NIS2 Directive affect cloud providers?</p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud providers must implement robust security measures to comply with the directive and protect services from cyber threats.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What happens if you don't comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">Non-compliance can lead to penalties such as fines and sanctions, along with increased cyber risks and disruptions to critical services.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How can organizations comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">By conducting risk assessments, implementing security controls, establishing incident response procedures, and promoting cybersecurity awareness.</p></li></ul>\n\n[You can perform a free risk assessment right now](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/) to see where your company stands in terms of cloud security and find out the most actionable insights that can improve your business’ cloud security posture. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"The Cloud Compliance Landscape in 2024: DORA, CIS, and More","seoTitle":"The Cloud Compliance Landscape in 2024: DORA, CIS, and More","description":"What are the regulatory changes in 2024 to ensure continued compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for DORA?","seoDescription":"What are the regulatory changes in 2024 to ensure continued compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for DORA?","date":"2024-01-24T14:28:56.143Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cloud-compliance-2024-dora-cis","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/d6cae/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png","srcSet":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/ac644/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 205w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/89b47/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 410w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/d6cae/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/913d0/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 205w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/91660/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 410w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/888e2/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"Keeping track of changing requirements in compliance standards and laws is a time-consuming job that quickly becomes overwhelming given the volume of updates and new benchmarks affecting broad and niche business sectors.  \n\nThis article is a compilation of changes businesses should be aware of in 2024, so they can ensure continued compliance with the most well-known regulatory frameworks, such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for incoming regulations such as DORA. \n\n## DORA: Incoming \n\nDORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) comes into power on the 17th of January 2025, and it’s a big one because it will affect everybody in the financial sector, not just banks. So affected companies should be spending a good amount of time in 2024 planning and preparing.  \n\nDORA is an EU regulatory standard for financial institutions with activity in the European Union, but it also applies to entities outside of the EU which provide ICT services to financial entities within the EU. \n\nEssentially, the regulation seeks to ensure that financial services firms and institutions can recover and get back up and running quickly after a security incident. The aim is to minimize the impact on customers and consumers.   \n\nThe focus is on harmonizing internal processes while strengthening transparency and the monitoring of third-party service providers such as cloud services platforms. It’s really all about context and being able to see technological connections across the entire business and understanding how and where there are vulnerabilities. Ultimately this helps to ensure not just the continuity of service delivery, but also the business’s ability to keep making money. \n\nThis has led observers to note that DORA could become a template to be adopted by other regulatory models. In fact, [a recent report from PWC](https://www.pwc.lu/en/digital-operational-resilience-act/dora-what-matters-now-for-your-business-resilience.html) proposes that instead of seeing DORA “as a mere compliance matter, financial entities should view it as an opportunity to enhance their digital operational resilience and proactively ready themselves for upcoming regulations pertaining to other facets of the digital realm, namely Artificial Intelligence.” \n\nWe have [a detailed article on DORA](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) that you can check out for more information and for a list of requirements related to cloud security and operational risk management. \n\n## CIS Benchmarks: Updated \n\n[CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) are configuration recommendations for more than 25 vendor product families, and they receive regular updates every year. Here are the latest versions for the most important CIS Benchmarks related to the cloud: \n\n* [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure). The previous version, v1.5.0., was released in August 2022. The latest version appeared in February of 2023.  \n* [CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) appeared in June of 2023, and was previously released in August of 2022. \n* [Google Cloud](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform) [Platform 1.3.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform) was previously updated in 2022.  \n* [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.8.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes). The newest version was released at the end of September 2023.  \n\nCIS updates usually contain anything from additional requirements to text revisions and removing deprecated recommendations. These standards are highly regarded and very useful, and we recommend using them when planning your cloud security strategy for 2024 and beyond.  \n\n## PCI-DSS: March 2024 deadline \n\n2024 is a big year for compliance across many industries, especially those that deal with financial information. PCI-DSS, which relates to the processing and storing of credit card data, saw its latest version, 4.0, emerge in March of 2022.  \n\nThe regulation allowed companies a transition period of two years due to its extensive changes, meaning the clock is ticking down to end-March this year. While companies still have a little time to become accredited for version 4.0, compliance with version 3.2.0 is still required in the meantime. \n\n[PCI-DSS v4.0](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-version-4/) has many additional requirements in all categories, regulating logging and monitoring, authentication, vulnerability scanning, and many others. This is why it makes sense why the PCI SSC (The PCI Security Standards Council) has granted companies two years to become compliant. \n\nFor instructions on implementing the requirements using Cyscale controls, [this guide has all the steps you need](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/).  \n\n## NIST: Version 2.0 arrives \n\nThe long-awaited [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/29/the-nist-cybersecurity-framework-20/ipd) will be out this year, and we're excited about it! NIST released the first version of the framework in 2014 and later in 2018 updated it into what it is now – version 1.1. It's been five years – a long time coming.  \n\nIn 2023 multiple drafts have been released, and the CSF is expected to be ready in early 2024. \n\n<img src=\"/img/csf-timeline.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"  style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\nSource: <https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/updating-nist-cybersecurity-framework-journey-csf-20>, Credit: Kristina Rigopoulos \n\n[According to NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/just-released-nist-csf-2-0-reference-tool), the new version will set out to: \n\n* expand the current scope, \n* add a sixth function, Govern, which covers decision-making around cybersecurity in terms of people, processes, and technology, and relates to the five other functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover (to read about the other functions, read [our detailed article on NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/)), \n* improve the guidance on implementing the CSF. \n\n## HITRUST: Setting the standard in healthcare \n\nThe most recent version of [HITRUST](https://cyscale.com/blog/hitrust-compliance-in-the-cloud/) (11.2.0) was released in November of 2023. It contains 14 control categories, divided into 49 objectives with 156 control references. Control references are requirements and best practices.  \n\nHITRUST is a framework for securing and managing information in the healthcare industry. This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. Let’s just say it’s [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/)’s big sister, with a whopping 516 pages that seem very intimidating in terms of implementation, but with benefits in terms of credibility and assurance that are not to be underestimated. \n\n## 2024: A busy year for cloud compliance professionals  \n\nAs is now typical, 2024 is going to be another busy year for compliance. As adoption of the cloud grows, so do the rules and regulations governing its usage. Along with the updates to standards listed above, we cannot ignore the steps taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, pushing for US companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents they experience along with material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.  \n\nOther regions should take note because the SEC also adopted rules requiring foreign private issuers to make comparable disclosures. We are likely to see more regulatory developments that put CISOs and other security and compliance leaders [in the spotlight of responsibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/).  \n\n#### M﻿anage your cloud compliance posture\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/compliance-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\nFind out how Cyscale can help you keep up with the continuous changes in the cybersecurity landscape and achieve (and maintain) compliance with less stress.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Cloud Compliance 101: From Basics to Best Practices","seoTitle":"Cloud Compliance 101: Basics, Best Practices & Tools - Cyscale","description":"Explore the intricacies of cloud compliance, from foundational knowledge to industry best practices.

As cloud services and cloud computing advance, the importance of cloud compliance becomes increasingly crucial. Dive into this guide as we explore the foundations and best practices of [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/). \n\n## The Basics of Cloud Compliance \n\n### What is Cloud Compliance? \n\nCloud compliance refers to the standards and laws set by regulation bodies to ensure data stored on the cloud remains safe, private, and within the boundaries of set cybersecurity rules. These rules often pertain to industries handling sensitive data, like healthcare (with HIPAA requirements) or e-commerce (following PCI DSS guidelines). \n\n### Key Regulations and Standards \n\n* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: This standard is focused around safeguarding credit card transactions. It regulates how cardholder data is stored and transmitted. \n* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: HIPAA is a United States healthcare law that refers to patient data and how it should be stored and used by companies. Moreover, this law covers how companies should act if patient PII is leaked. \n* **SOC 2**: Evaluates a company's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. \n* **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: Provides standards and guidelines for federal agencies to architect and secure their information systems. There are three frameworks that can be used when establishing compliance with the [NIST standard](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/): NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53, and NIST 800-171. \n* **ISO 27001**: This standard ensures that the organization has an effective and secure information security management. \n* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: GDPR is the most well-known and important European regulation protecting personal data. \n\n## Shared Responsibility Model \n\nThe shared responsibility model is a concept that defines how security responsibilities are divided between the cloud service provider (CSP), and the cloud user. This model outlines which party is responsible of each component of a cloud environment. For example, the cloud service provider is responsible of the physical security of the cloud computing infrastructure, while the customer takes care of their apps, data, and workloads. \n\nThe most popular cloud service providers are: \n\n1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n2. Google Cloud \n3. Microsoft Azure \n\nAll major providers have, and regularly renew, their certificates of compliance with regulations. However, the weight of these regular updates also falls on the users’ shoulders: they still have the responsibility of getting certified to prove that the way they make use of cloud services (for apps, data, and workloads) matches the standard requirement. \n\n## Best Practices for Cloud Compliance \n\n### 1. Regular Audits \n\nRoutine checks are critical to identify potential vulnerabilities. Utilize tools like [cloud misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) to improve your cloud's security posture. \n\n### 2. Automation in Compliance \n\nBy integrating automation in compliance processes, you can help your company streamline future audits and achieve compliance easier. The Cyscale Cloud Platform removes a lot of the manual work that’s usually involved in preparing for and gathering evidence for an audit, offering support for popular standards such as [PCI DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/) or [ISO27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/). \n\n### 3. Education and Training \n\nThe realm of cloud security and compliance is ever-evolving. Continuous learning ensures your organization adheres to best practices, especially concerning cybersecurity. Moreover, conducting training for all employees of your company to help them understand how current prevalent attacks such as phishing work and how to protect themselves from them is a necessary step to protecting your organization. \n\n### 4. Data Management and Security \n\nGuard your sensitive data, with special attention for multi-cloud environments. While data security is vital in any computing environment, multi-cloud environments introduce additional complexities that require a heightened level of vigilance. Embrace encryption, multi-factor authentication, and API-level security. \n\n## Navigating Challenges \n\n### 1. Common Challenges in Cloud Compliance\n\nTo be able to address challenges in cloud compliance, you need to understand what some of the most common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are: \n\n* Poor access control, \n* Insufficient logging and monitoring, \n* Lack of encryption or the use of inadequate cryptographic algorithms, \n* Weak authentication, and others. \n\n### 2. Case Studies \n\nDive into scenarios where businesses faced cloud security challenges and understand the strategies they employed. Two examples of situations Cyscale has been helping companies with are: \n\n* [Lack of contextual visibility](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/) in a complex cloud environment \n* [A time-consuming compliance process](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech/) \n\n## How can Cyscale help? \n\nOffering unparalleled contextual visibility across cloud and data repositories, Cyscale grants organizations the power to scrutinize everything from resource-level configurations to their holistic compliance posture.

In this article, we will discuss all the deadlines by which you have to become compliant, details about the new requirements, and everything else you need to know about PCI DSS version 4.\n\n## Timeline and deadlines\n\nPCI DSS version 4 appeared at the end of March 2022 and its requirements will become mandatory in two phases: the first one is March of 2024, and the final one is March of 2025.\n\nThe new version brings considerable changes, but most of the new requirements will not be mandatory until 2025. However, companies that manage to fulfill them before 2025 can audit them.\n\nThe old version, PCI DSS 3.2.0., will remain active until the 31st of March, 2024, to allow companies enough time to recertify with the new version.\n\n## Changes in PCI DSS version 4, explained\n\nNew requirements have been added to all of the categories to better reflect the current cybersecurity landscape. Some examples of areas covered by the new requirements include the authentication process, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and others.\n\nMost of the sections have been revised or contain new requirements.\n\nPCI DSS is structured into twelve requirements, and each contains its own sections. The requirements are:\n\n### 1. Install and maintain network security controls\n\nThis requirement now specifies “network security controls” instead of “firewalls”, to cover more network security technologies. All of the sections in this category have been changed to the following:\n\n* 1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.\n* 1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.\n* 1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.\n* 1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.\n* 1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.\n\n### 2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components\n\nThis requirement was initially named “Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.”. Now, it refers to all of the company’s configurations, and not only to using vendor-supplied defaults. The sections in this category are the following:\n\n* 2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.\n* 2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.\n* 2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.\n\n### 3. Protect Stored Account Data\n\nWith the third requirement, the focus is switched to account data, compared to the old version, where “cardholder data\" was mentioned instead. New sections are added in relation to PAN (Primary Account Number) and SAD (Sensitive Authentication Data) which cover the storage, encryption and hashing of this data.\n\n* 3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.\n* 3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.\n* 3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.\n* 3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.\n* 3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.\n* 3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.\n* 3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key lifecycle are defined and implemented.\n\n### 4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks\n\n“Strong cryptography” is now part of the 4th requirement name, to highlight the importance of using appropriate algorithms. The new sections introduce rules regarding the storage and usage of keys and certificates. \n\n* 4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.  \n* 4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission. \n\n### 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software \n\nThis requirement has been renamed, replacing “anti-virus” with “malicious” software to cover a broader range of technologies. Moreover, sections in this category now regulate the frequency of scans and checks, as well as other aspects.\n\n* 5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.\n* 5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.\n* 5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.\n* 5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.\n\n### 6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software\n\nIn this requirement, one of the new sections added (6.4) refers to automating the detection and prevention of attacks over public-facing web apps. Sections 6.1 and 6.3 also contain new requirements.\n\n* 6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.\n* 6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.\n* 6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.\n* 6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.\n* 6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.\n\n### 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know\n\nThis requirement includes new rules regarding the review of user accounts and their privileges, as well as the management and privileges of applications and system accounts.\n\n* 7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.\n* 7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.\n* 7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).\n\n### 8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components \n\nMany new sections regarding MFA, credentials and the entire authentication process have been added in this requirement. Two examples of changes that companies compliant with PCI DSS have to implement now are: the minimum length of a user account password has increased from 7 to 12 characters, and companies are not allowed to store passwords/passphrases in scripts or files.\n\n* 8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.\n* 8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.\n* 8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.\n* 8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.\n* 8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.\n* 8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.\n\n### 9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data \n\nThis requirement does not have many changes. Some sections that refer to roles and responsibilities, as well as the frequency of device inspections have been added.\n\n* 9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.\n* 9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.\n* 9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.\n* 9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.\n* 9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.\n\n### 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data \n\nNew sections in this requirement regulate the automation of logging, prompt response to failed security controls, as well as how often logs should be reviewed:\n\n* 10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.\n* 10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.\n* 10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.\n* 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.\n* 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.\n* 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.\n* 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.\n\n### 11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly\n\nThis category includes the following:\n\n* a new requirement to manage all applicable vulnerabilities,\n* a new requirement to perform internal vulnerability scans via authenticated scanning,\n* a new requirement to deploy a change-and-tamper-detection mechanism to alert for unauthorized modifications to the HTTP headers and contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser, [according to PCI SSC](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r1.pdf).\n\nThe full list of the sections included in this requirement is:\n\n* 11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.\n* 11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.\n* 11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.\n* 11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.\n* 11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.\n* 11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.\n\n### 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs\n\nThe title modification reflects that the focus is on organizational policies and programs. In PCI DSS version 4, requirements specify that the audited company should, at least every 12 months:\n\n* document and review cryptographic cipher suites and protocols,\n* review hardware and software components,\n* document the PCI DSS scope,\n* review and update the security awareness program, among other requirements, which are presented below.\n\n \n\n* 12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.\n* 12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.\n* 12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.\n* 12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.\n* 12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.\n* 12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.\n* 12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.\n* 12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.\n* 12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.\n* 12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.\n\n## What do you have to do now? \n\nYou have to become PCI-DSS version 4 certified until the 31st of March 2024. There are two possible paths for your company:\n\n1. Your company is already PCI-DSS certified, so until the first deadline you must cover some of the new requirements and until the last deadline all of them, or\n2. Your company is not PCI-DSS certified, so you have to start from the beginning with the new PCI-DSS version and fulfill all requirements according to the specified deadlines.\n\nThis new version of PCI DSS brings considerable changes, and the process of achieving compliance with PCI DSS can be long and cumbersome.\n\nCyscale helps companies accelerate their cloud compliance process and ace audits by providing:\n\n* security controls that check if you’re implementing the requirements correctly, and\n* a page for each standard where you can track your progress and history.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","description":"DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) is a compliance standard destined for financial institutions that regulates operational risk management.

This means that **financial companies have less than 2 years left to become compliant with DORA** and successfully manage operational risk. \n\nThe usage of cloud computing is witnessing a steady rise in 2023, and the financial sector is embracing this trend with open arms. \n\nTo understand DORA and its implication for cloud infrastructures in financial companies, let's look at the requirements and how an organization can become compliant with it. \n\n## Structure \n\nDORA has nine chapters that include general provisions, ICT risk management, digital operational resilience testing, and others.  \n\nThe chapter that contains technical requirements that apply to cloud environments is the second one, **ICT risk management**. In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* To check if your cloud environment is secure, run a free health check with Cyscale now.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><img src=\"/img/security-posture.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/></a>\n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-6 lg:pb-2 lg:pt-6 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">Start assessment</button></a></div>\n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA.

Technology Risk Governance and Oversight \n2. Technology Risk Management Framework \n3. IT Project Management and Security-by-Design \n4. Software Application Development and Management \n5.

High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 268 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\n<img src=\"/img/33_blog-mas-standard.webp\" alt=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"NIST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"NIST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"NIST (The National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a compliance standard that develops best practices and security standards for government organizations or contractors.

Still, companies outside this range also choose to become NIST compliant due to the excellent reputation and benefits of the standard. \n\nThree NIST frameworks can be used when establishing NIST compliance: \n\n* NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* NIST 800-53, \n* NIST 800-171. \n\nLet’s look at them in detail to understand the differences. \n\n## NIST Cybersecurity Framework \n\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) gathers best practices and standards to help companies build a robust cybersecurity program and manage risk.  \n\nThe framework contains 5 core functions, which contain 23 categories, which in turn are divided into 108 subcategories formulated as outcomes. Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing the right NIST framework and ensuring [cloud compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/) is a pivotal task.\\\nCyscale is here to guide you, making the **[NIST cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/)** journey simpler.

Following cybersecurity best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its cloud computing environments.\n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments and prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.webp\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege for access control, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all cloud data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks and data breaches.. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 security controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies regulatory compliance requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. healthcare federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous regulatory requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation.\n\nTo read more about these compliance standards, as well as NIST, check out our [whitepaper](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/the-complete-guide-to-cloud-compliance/). \n\nUnderstanding **cloud compliance** is crucial for organizations that want to ensure both the security and legality of their cloud operations.
