In this article, we will discuss all the deadlines by which you have to become compliant, details about the new requirements, and everything else you need to know about PCI DSS version 4.\n\n## Timeline and deadlines\n\nPCI DSS version 4 appeared at the end of March 2022 and its requirements will become mandatory in two phases: the first one is March of 2024, and the final one is March of 2025.\n\nThe new version brings considerable changes, but most of the new requirements will not be mandatory until 2025. However, companies that manage to fulfill them before 2025 can audit them.\n\nThe old version, PCI DSS 3.2.0., will remain active until the 31st of March, 2024, to allow companies enough time to recertify with the new version.\n\n## Changes in PCI DSS version 4, explained\n\nNew requirements have been added to all of the categories to better reflect the current cybersecurity landscape. Some examples of areas covered by the new requirements include the authentication process, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and others.\n\nMost of the sections have been revised or contain new requirements.\n\nPCI DSS is structured into twelve requirements, and each contains its own sections. The requirements are:\n\n### 1. Install and maintain network security controls\n\nThis requirement now specifies “network security controls” instead of “firewalls”, to cover more network security technologies. All of the sections in this category have been changed to the following:\n\n* 1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.\n* 1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.\n* 1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.\n* 1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.\n* 1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.\n\n### 2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components\n\nThis requirement was initially named “Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.”. Now, it refers to all of the company’s configurations, and not only to using vendor-supplied defaults. The sections in this category are the following:\n\n* 2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.\n* 2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.\n* 2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.\n\n### 3. Protect Stored Account Data\n\nWith the third requirement, the focus is switched to account data, compared to the old version, where “cardholder data\" was mentioned instead. New sections are added in relation to PAN (Primary Account Number) and SAD (Sensitive Authentication Data) which cover the storage, encryption and hashing of this data.\n\n* 3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.\n* 3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.\n* 3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.\n* 3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.\n* 3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.\n* 3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.\n* 3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key lifecycle are defined and implemented.\n\n### 4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks\n\n“Strong cryptography” is now part of the 4th requirement name, to highlight the importance of using appropriate algorithms. The new sections introduce rules regarding the storage and usage of keys and certificates. \n\n* 4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.  \n* 4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission. \n\n### 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software \n\nThis requirement has been renamed, replacing “anti-virus” with “malicious” software to cover a broader range of technologies. Moreover, sections in this category now regulate the frequency of scans and checks, as well as other aspects.\n\n* 5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.\n* 5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.\n* 5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.\n* 5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.\n\n### 6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software\n\nIn this requirement, one of the new sections added (6.4) refers to automating the detection and prevention of attacks over public-facing web apps. Sections 6.1 and 6.3 also contain new requirements.\n\n* 6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.\n* 6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.\n* 6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.\n* 6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.\n* 6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.\n\n### 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know\n\nThis requirement includes new rules regarding the review of user accounts and their privileges, as well as the management and privileges of applications and system accounts.\n\n* 7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.\n* 7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.\n* 7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).\n\n### 8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components \n\nMany new sections regarding MFA, credentials and the entire authentication process have been added in this requirement. Two examples of changes that companies compliant with PCI DSS have to implement now are: the minimum length of a user account password has increased from 7 to 12 characters, and companies are not allowed to store passwords/passphrases in scripts or files.\n\n* 8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.\n* 8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.\n* 8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.\n* 8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.\n* 8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.\n* 8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.\n\n### 9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data \n\nThis requirement does not have many changes. Some sections that refer to roles and responsibilities, as well as the frequency of device inspections have been added.\n\n* 9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.\n* 9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.\n* 9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.\n* 9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.\n* 9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.\n\n### 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data \n\nNew sections in this requirement regulate the automation of logging, prompt response to failed security controls, as well as how often logs should be reviewed:\n\n* 10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.\n* 10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.\n* 10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.\n* 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.\n* 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.\n* 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.\n* 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.\n\n### 11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly\n\nThis category includes the following:\n\n* a new requirement to manage all applicable vulnerabilities,\n* a new requirement to perform internal vulnerability scans via authenticated scanning,\n* a new requirement to deploy a change-and-tamper-detection mechanism to alert for unauthorized modifications to the HTTP headers and contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser, [according to PCI SSC](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r1.pdf).\n\nThe full list of the sections included in this requirement is:\n\n* 11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.\n* 11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.\n* 11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.\n* 11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.\n* 11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.\n* 11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.\n\n### 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs\n\nThe title modification reflects that the focus is on organizational policies and programs. In PCI DSS version 4, requirements specify that the audited company should, at least every 12 months:\n\n* document and review cryptographic cipher suites and protocols,\n* review hardware and software components,\n* document the PCI DSS scope,\n* review and update the security awareness program, among other requirements, which are presented below.\n\n \n\n* 12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.\n* 12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.\n* 12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.\n* 12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.\n* 12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.\n* 12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.\n* 12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.\n* 12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.\n* 12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.\n* 12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.\n\n## What do you have to do now? \n\nYou have to become PCI-DSS version 4 certified until the 31st of March 2024. There are two possible paths for your company:\n\n1. Your company is already PCI-DSS certified, so until the first deadline you must cover some of the new requirements and until the last deadline all of them, or\n2. Your company is not PCI-DSS certified, so you have to start from the beginning with the new PCI-DSS version and fulfill all requirements according to the specified deadlines.\n\nThis new version of PCI DSS brings considerable changes, and the process of achieving compliance with PCI DSS can be long and cumbersome.\n\nCyscale helps companies accelerate their cloud compliance process and ace audits by providing:\n\n* security controls that check if you’re implementing the requirements correctly, and\n* a page for each standard where you can track your progress and history.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance","News"],"title":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","description":"DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) is a compliance standard destined for financial institutions that regulates operational risk management.

This means that **financial companies have less than 2 years left to become compliant with DORA** and successfully manage operational risk. \n\nThe usage of cloud computing is witnessing a steady rise in 2023, and the financial sector is embracing this trend with open arms. \n\nTo understand DORA and its implication for cloud infrastructures in financial companies, let's look at the requirements and how an organization can become compliant with it. \n\n## Structure \n\nDORA has nine chapters that include general provisions, ICT risk management, digital operational resilience testing, and others.  \n\nThe chapter that contains technical requirements that apply to cloud environments is the second one, **ICT risk management**. In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* \n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA.

Technology Risk Governance and Oversight \n2. Technology Risk Management Framework \n3. IT Project Management and Security-by-Design \n4. Software Application Development and Management \n5. IT Service Management \n6. IT Resilience \n7. Access Control \n8. Cryptography \n9. Data and Infrastructure Security \n10. Cyber Security Operations \n11. Cyber Security Assessment \n12. Online Financial Services \n13. IT Audit \n\nThese sections contain subsections that describe in detail the best practices that should be followed for each area covered by that section.  \n\nIt is important to note that MAS TRM Guidelines does not contain any specific controls, and it is up to the organization to create and tailor controls to fulfill each section's recommendations. \n\nIn this article, we will look in detail at the sections that may apply for cloud environments and understand the requirements. \n\n## IT Resilience  \n\nThis section describes the importance of: \n\n* Availability,  \n* Recoverability, \n* Disaster recovery, \n* Backups,  \n* Data centre resilience. \n\n**Availability** ensures users can access data without interruption. High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 268 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\n<img src=\"/img/33_blog-mas-standard.webp\" alt=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"NIST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"NIST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"NIST (The National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a compliance standard that develops best practices and security standards for government organizations or contractors.

Still, companies outside this range also choose to become NIST compliant due to the excellent reputation and benefits of the standard. \n\nThree NIST frameworks can be used when establishing NIST compliance: \n\n* NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* NIST 800-53, \n* NIST 800-171. \n\nLet’s look at them in detail to understand the differences. \n\n## NIST Cybersecurity Framework \n\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) gathers best practices and standards to help companies build a robust cybersecurity program and manage risk.  \n\nThe framework contains 5 core functions, which contain 23 categories, which in turn are divided into 108 subcategories formulated as outcomes. Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing the right NIST framework and ensuring compliance is a pivotal task.\\\nCyscale is here to guide you, making the **[NIST cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/)** journey simpler.

Following cybersecurity best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its cloud computing environments.\n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments and prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.webp\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege for access control, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all cloud data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks and data breaches.. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 security controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies regulatory compliance requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. healthcare federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous regulatory requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation.\n\nTo read more about these compliance standards, as well as NIST, check out our [whitepaper](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/the-complete-guide-to-cloud-compliance/). \n\nOur [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/)  can help you secure your cloud environment and become compliant with respected accreditations through: \n\n* Over 400 controls, across multiple public cloud service providers, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Google Cloud, that help you stay on top of your security program, \n* Both pre-configured and editable security policies that can be associated to controls, \n* Powerful identity and security dashboards for enhanced visibility over your cloud infrastructure, and others. \n\nSecure your cloud infrastructure effectively with expert insights on cloud security and compliance best practices and international standards.

This version is bringing considerable changes to the old [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/). Let's examine them and understand what they might mean to your company.  \n\n## The Changes \n\n### 1. The structure of the standard has changed. \n\nInstead of 14 clauses in Annex A that categorized the controls, ISO 27001:2022 groups all controls into four themes: \n\n* People (8 controls), \n* Organizational (37 controls), \n* Technological (34 controls),  \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\n### 2. Some controls have been merged or renamed. \n\nISO 27001:2022 contains 93 controls, instead of 114. Let’s look at examples of controls that have been modified: \n\n1. **A.18.1.1** Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements, and \n2. **A.18.1.5** Regulation of cryptographic controls. \n\nHave been merged into: \n\n1. **A.5.31** Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. \n\nA control that remained the same but has been moved to a different section is: \n\n> **A.18.1.2 Intellectual property rights.**  \n\nIt has been modified to: \n\n> **A.5.32 Intellectual property rights.** \n\n### 3. New controls have been added \n\nBelow, you can see the list of the 11 new controls added to Annex A of the ISO 27001:2022 standard. \n\n1. Threat intelligence (A.5.7) \n2. Information security for the use of cloud services (A.5.23) \n3. ICT readiness for business continuity (A.5.30) \n4. Physical security monitoring (A.7.4) \n5. Configuration management (A.8.9) \n6. Information deletion (A.8.10) \n7. Data masking (A.8.11) \n8. Data leakage prevention (A.8.12) \n9. Monitoring activities (A.8.16) \n10. Web filtering (A.8.23) \n11. Secure coding (A.8.28) \n\nA notable control is 5.23, “Information security for the use of cloud services”, since now, cloud security has a dedicated control. This preventative control is designed to keep risk at a minimum and regulate the management and usage of cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This control covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n\n### 4. Controls have attributes \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001-and-iso27002-2022-updates), controls can now be categorized based on 5 different attributes, with the mentioned values: \n\n* **Control type** (preventive, detective, corrective) \n* **Information security properties** (confidentiality, integrity, availability) \n* **Cybersecurity concepts** (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover) \n* **Operational capabilities** (governance, asset management, etc.) \n* **Security domains** (governance and ecosystem, protection, defense, resilience) \n\nUsing these attributes, your company can organize the controls based on their scope. \n\n## What does this mean to a CISO? \n\nThe [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) certification has a three-year validity, and the old version of the standard will be valid until it expires. Therefore, companies have a three-year period to recertify and become compliant with the new version of ISO 27001. This means that, at the latest, companies must recertify before the 31st of October 2025.  \n\nThe process of obtaining the [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) certification is time-consuming and difficult. However, you can make this task easier with Cyscale. \n\nCyscale helps you become compliant with international standards by providing hundreds of controls that help you secure your cloud environment, ensure you have implemented the requirements for international standards, and also aid you when going through audits. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Compliance"],"title":"AWS SOC 2 Compliance Checklist: A Detailed Guide","seoTitle":"AWS SOC 2 Compliance Checklist: A Detailed Guide","description":"SOC 2 is a compliance standard that regulates the way data security is handled within B2B (business-to-business) organizations.

SOC (Service and Organization Controls) 2 is an international standard developed by AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). \n\nIn this article, we will understand what requirements your company needs to fulfill to obtain the [SOC 2 certifications](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/) and how to implement them correctly in your AWS environment. \n\n### The requirements \n\nFirstly, the rules within SOC 2 are grouped by 5 TSC (Trust Service Criteria): \n\n1. Security \n2. Availability \n3. Processing Integrity \n4. Confidentiality \n5. Privacy \n\nSOC 2 has 64 mandatory trust service criteria, based on these which the company creates controls to achieve compliance. In this article, we will look at a few of the criteria required, how to implement them in your AWS environment and how to check if your implementation is complete. \n\n##### A checklist \n\n### Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials \n\nMFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a mechanism that adds additional steps to the authentication flow and requests supplementary credentials. These credentials can be: \n\n* What you know (for example: a password) \n* What you have (for example: a smart card) \n* What you are (for example: a fingerprint) \n\nTo fulfill this criteria, introduced under the “Security” section, you need to enable MFA when accessing the AWS Management Console. As a result, users will be prompted to enter their username and password (which is the first step, or the first factor of the authentication), and then an authentication code that is sent to their device. A biometrics-enabled device can be used instead as well. \n\nYou can configure MFA for IAM users or the AWS account root user. \n\nSteps to enable MFA in your AWS environment, according to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html). \n\n6. Install an authenticator app on your MFA device, use a FIDO2 device or specialized hardware devices such as TOTP tokens. \n7. Enable the MFA device from the AWS Management Console (if using an authenticator app, you can also use AWS CLI or AWS API). \n\nIf your company is using an external identity provider, you have to ensure that MFA is configured for access to the AWS console. \n\n### Restricts Access \n\nThis criteria, in the “Security” TSC refers to restricting traffic to and from any cloud services and assets hosted in the cloud. This includes: \n\n* Closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* Requiring authenticated access to services such as FTP, SMB, and others. \n\nTo close an open port, follow these steps: \n\n1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. \n2. From the EC2 dashboard, on the left pane, click Security Groups. \n3. For each security group, click the Inbound Rules tab, and remove the rules that allow access to the ports you want to close. Repeat the same for the Outbound Rules. \n4. Remember to click save. \n\n### Implements Boundary Protection Systems \n\nThe third requirement we will analyze under the \"Security\" section of SOC refers to the usage of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), IDS, IPS, and others.  \n\nIt is recommended that you secure your cloud infrastructure by using these utilities in order to limit traffic as much as possible and only allow access to resources when necessary. \n\nTo quickly deploy a firewall: \n\n* Log in to the AWS Management Console, \n* Open the Amazon VPC console, create a firewall subnet, and update your VPC Route Tables. \n* Configure the firewall policy by accessing the Amazon VPC console navigation pane under Network Firewall. Choose Firewall policies and add any desired configurations. \n\n### Creates and Maintains Records of System Storage Activities \n\nThis criteria, located under the “Processing Integrity” criteria, checks if logging is implemented in your cloud environment.  \n\nBy logging all user activities, you can: \n\n* Observe [misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/), \n* Identify any suspicious behavior, \n* Detect malicious attacks. \n\nTo enable logging in your AWS infrastructure, you can use Amazon CloudTrail. This solution tracks all actions performed in your cloud environment.  \n\nAmazon CloudTrail can be used together with Amazon CloudWatch to extend monitoring to applications and cloud assets and to analyze their health. \n\n**Amazon CloudTrail is enabled by default in your AWS account.** \n\n### Protects Encryption Keys \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is essential to ensure confidentiality of data. In the “Confidentiality” section of SOC 2, we have criteria for both encryption and key management.  \n\nIf key management is neglected, then encryption becomes useless. Keys must be generated, stored, used and destroyed safely to protect your data. \n\nAmazon offers a complete solution for proper key management. AWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) helps you properly deal with all of the processes in a cryptographic key’s lifecycle. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used:  \n\n* Through the AWS Management Console,  \n* Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### Finally, check your implementations \n\nBesides the criteria presented in this article, there are many more. \n\nAlthough so many requirements can quickly become overwhelming, Cyscale can help you easily keep track of what you’ve correctly implemented and what requires your attention on our [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) compliance page. \n\nMany technical controls in Cyscale can be mapped to SOC 2 criteria to provide visibility in your cloud environment and prove compliance. \n\nA few examples of controls that apply to the presented requirements (and more) are: \n\n* Ensure all users have MFA configured. \n* Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions. \n* Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 (SSH). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud ","seoTitle":"HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud ","description":"The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a United States federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and individuals’ personal health information (PHI).

According to the [Medicare Learning Network](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/HIPAAPrivacyandSecurity.pdf), the three rules are: \n\n* The Privacy Rule, \n* The Security Rule, \n* The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nWe will look at each in detail to understand how compliance with HIPAA can be achieved in the cloud. \n\n## The Privacy Rule \n\nThe Privacy Rule contains standards that regulate the usage and disclosure of PHI. This section of HIPAA includes a wide range of rules that protect an individual's rights to: \n\n* Access and obtain digital copies of their medical records, \n* Request corrections regarding their medical records, \n* Restrict access to some of their information. \n\nThe Privacy Rule also contains instructions for the medical provider. A medical professional must: \n\n1. Keep PHI secure and disable access to it unless the person requesting access is authorized to access it, \n2. Inform patients about their privacy rights and others. \n\n## The Security Rule \n\nThis rule refers to electronic PHI (ePHI). It requires that ePHI data is stored, accessed, and transferred under the three cybersecurity principles: \n\n1. Confidentiality,  \n2. Availability, \n3. Integrity. \n\nLet’s understand what these three principles require: \n\n* **Confidentiality**: Make sure no unauthorized individual can access or read the ePHI. \n* **Availability**: Authorized persons should be able at all times to access the ePHI, as needed. \n* **Integrity**: ePHI should not be altered or deleted by unauthorized entities. \n\n## The Breach Notification Rule \n\nThe third rule in HIPAA refers to how a medical professional should respond to a PHI breach.  \n\nThe parties that should always be notified of a breach are: \n\n* The affected individual or individuals, and \n* The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \n\n## Consequences of HIPAA violations \n\nSince HIPAA is a federal law, there are two types of penalties that can be applied: \n\n* Financial penalties, \n* Criminal penalties. \n\nThese repercussions depend on the gravity of the violation. According to [HIPAA Answers](https://www.hipaanswers.com/hipaa-violation-penalties/), there are four violation categories: \n\n1. A violation that was not known and could not have been realistically avoided. \n2. A violation that the responsible parties should have been aware of but could not have been avoided. \n3. A violation due to negligence, where correction attempts were made to correct it. \n4. A violation due to negligence, with no attempts made to correct it. \n\nThe **financial penalties** are also split into four categories: \n\n1. Minimum fine of $128 per violation up to $63,973, \n2. Minimum fine of $1,280 per violation up to $63,973, \n3. Minimum fine of $12,794 per violation up to $63,973, \n4. Minimum fine of $63,973 per violation up to $1,919,173. \n\n**Criminal penalties** are divided into three categories: \n\n* For reasonable cause or no knowledge of the violation: up to one year in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI under false pretenses: up to five years in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI for personal gain or malicious attempt: up to ten years in jail. \n\n## HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud: A Checklist \n\nAfter we've understood the importance of compliance with HIPAA, let's see the requirements that need to be fulfilled. They are grouped into three categories: \n\n* Technical Safeguards, \n* Administrative Safeguards, \n* Physical Safeguards.  \n\nLet’s look at them more in detail and understand how Cyscale can help you become compliant with HIPAA. \n\n### 1. Technical Safeguards \n\nTechnical Safeguards are split into four categories. We will also show you examples of controls in Cyscale to help you understand how easy it is to implement them and streamline the process of becoming compliant. \n\n* Access control – only authorized entities should access ePHI. \n* Audit control – access to ePHI should be recorded and examined. \n* Integrity – ePHI should not be altered or destroyed by unauthorized individuals. \n* Transmission security – ePHI should be safely transmitted over the network. \n\nExamples of controls for some of these safeguards are: \n\n* **Access control:** *Ensure network access rule for storage bucket is not set to publicly accessible* for Alibaba Cloud. \n* **Audit control:** *Ensure that Object-level logging for write events is enabled for S3 bucket* for AWS. \n* **Transmission security:** *Ensure 'Enforce SSL connection' is set to 'ENABLED' for MySQL Database Server* for Azure. \n\n### 2. Administrative Safeguards \n\n* **Security Management Process** – analyze potential risks and take protective measures, \n* **Security Personnel** – a security officer should be responsible for security policies and procedures, \n* **Information Access Management** – limit access to PHI to [the minimum necessary](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), \n* **Workforce Training and Management** – employees should receive training in PHI management and be supervised, \n* **Evaluation** – a periodic assessment of security policies should be performed. \n\nTwo examples of controls for the “Information Access Management” Safeguard are: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n\n### 3. Physical Safeguards \n\n* **Facility Access and Control** – access to a covered entity's facilities should be limited to authorized personnel, \n* **Workstation and Device Security** – policies and procedures should be implemented to regulate the usage and access to workstations and devices.  \n\nUse Cyscale to achieve compliance with HIPAA and other international standards. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance","CSPM"],"title":"SOC 2 Compliance in The Cloud","seoTitle":"SOC 2 Compliance in The Cloud","description":"SOC 2 is an international compliance standard that defines rules for B2B (business-to-business) organizations regarding data security.

Security \n2. Availability \n3. Processing Integrity \n4. Confidentiality \n5. Privacy \n\n## SOC 2 requirements, explained for cloud \n\nIn order to become [SOC 2 compliant](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/), you must fulfill 64 trust service criteria across the 5 TSCs mentioned above.. Based on them, the organization establishes corresponding controls to demonstrate compliance. \n\nIn this section, we will look at some of the points of focus necessary to obtain the accreditation. They should be taken into account by companies that use cloud services.  \n\nGrouped by criteria and explained, here are examples of requirements: \n\n#### 1. Security \n\n* Implements Boundary Protection Systems - The company uses firewalls, IDSs, DMZs to secure devices. \n* Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials - [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is configured for all users. \n\n#### 2. Availability \n\n* Designs Detection Measures - Logging and monitoring are implemented. \n* Implements Alerts to Analyze Anomalies – Targeted alerts are used to ensure fast remediation for high-priority assets. \n\n#### 3. Processing Integrity \n\n* Protects Stored Items – Sensitive data is safely stored in order to prevent it from being tampered. \n* Creates and Maintains Records of System Storage Activities – Logging and monitoring are required for this criterion as well. \n\n#### 4. Confidentiality \n\n* Restricts Logical Access– Access to sensitive cloud assets is limited, and the Least Privilege Principle is implemented. \n* Identifies and Authenticates Users – The company follows good practices regarding [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n#### 5. Privacy \n\n* Uses Encryption to Protect Data – All assets of type storage are encrypted. \n* Protects Identification and Authentication Credentials – Managing access to cloud assets is a matter of privacy since an entity that isn't authorized should not be able to access them. \n\n## How do you obtain the SOC 2 accreditation? \n\nThe process of obtaining it depends on the type of accreditation you’re going for. There are two types of SOC audits, which require different reports: \n\n* **Type 1:** a single audit and a single report are required at a specific date and time. For this type, the design of the security program put in place is evaluated. \n* **Type 2:** to obtain the SOC 2 Type 2 accreditation, an audit is carried out over a period of time, usually a minimum of six months. For type 2, the execution of the security program is evaluated. \n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both types.  \n\nWhile type 1 requires less effort and is easier to get, it is also less valuable, since the evaluation result only reflects the state of the company's data security at a given point in time.  \n\nWith type 2, you invest more time and resources into getting accredited, but the result shows more effort and commitment toward the customer's [data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nOnce you’ve decided which SOC 2 type you want to obtain, you need to start the long process of obtaining the accreditation. \n\n## Use Cyscale to make this process easier for you \n\nCyscale can help you obtain the SOC 2 accreditation for your company by: \n\n* checking with the use of in-app controls whether you're implementing the requirements, \n* providing you with remediation steps for any findings, \n* helping you to demonstrate, during the audit, that you’re SOC 2 compliant and should receive the accreditation. \n\nIn the image below, you can see a part of the SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale, which gives you metrics to know how you're doing in your process of becoming compliant. \n\n![SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale](/img/blog_16-soc-2-page-in-cyscale.webp#shadow \"SOC 2 standard page in Cyscale\")\n\nA large set of technical controls included in this standard are mapped to SOC 2 points of focus to easily understand which ones you’re correctly implementing, and which require your attention. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":2,"currentPage":1,"category":"Compliance","seoTitle":"Cyscale - Compliance","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale Compliance","categoriesList":["News","CSPM","Compliance","CNAPP","Product","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","632500807"]}
