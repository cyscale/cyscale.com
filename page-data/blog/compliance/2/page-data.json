In the following section, we will explain and map them to Cyscale controls to show you how to achieve a robust [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). Here are the 12 conditions: \n\n#### 1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data. \n\nTraffic to and from sensitive environments should be heavily filtered and restricted. Some examples of controls in Cyscale that ensure proper implementation are:  \n\n* *Ensure 'Enable connecting to serial ports' is not enabled for VM Instance* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters. \n\nThe first set of credentials attackers try when attempting to gain access to an account is the default one. You should always change the default passwords immediately after installing a feature.  \n\nAnother aspect to look out for is allowing default access configuration on cloud assets. \n\nExamples of controls that check if you’ve done this for the applications in your infrastructure are: \n\n* *Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users that have a console password* for AWS \n* *Ensure that Cloud Storage buckets are not anonymously or publicly accessible* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 3. Protect stored cardholder data. \n\nThis requirement covers encryption, hashing, masking of customer’s debit or credit card data, as well as other techniques. It is an essential step because, when implemented correctly, even if an attacker gains access to sensitive data, they will not be able to read it.  \n\nSome examples of controls that ensure you’re not storing unprotected data are: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure that ‘Data encryption’ is set to ‘On’ on a SQL Database* for Azure \n\n#### 4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks. \n\nAll cardholder data transmitted over the Internet should be encrypted, to prevent malicious entities from reading it while it is in transit. You can find below examples of controls that ensure this implementation: \n\n* *Ensure that 'Secure transfer required' is set to 'Enabled'* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure S3 Bucket Policy allows HTTPS requests* for AWS \n\n#### 5. Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs. \n\nMake sure security [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are enforced in the workplace, and anti-virus software, applications, and operating systems are up to date. \n\n#### 6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications. \n\nThe following devices and systems should be continuously secured and patched when dealing with cardholder data and transactions: \n\n* operating systems on virtual machines, \n* databases, \n* networking devices, \n* applications. \n\nExamples of controls in Cyscale that ensure this recommendation is attained are: \n\n* *Ensure Kubernetes web UI / Dashboard is disabled* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that App Engine applications enforce HTTPS connections* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know. \n\nMake sure only authorized personnel has access to customer’s card information and implement the Least Privilege Principle with the following controls: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs* for Google Cloud \n\n#### 8. Identify and authenticate access to system components. \n\nImplement a robust authentication system that does not allow weak password usage and ensures regular rotation of keys and credentials.  \n\nJust two of the many controls Cyscale uses to ensure this requirement is implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure IAM password policy requires at least one symbol* for AWS \n\n#### 9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data. \n\nAccess to databases, computers, servers and other devices should be heavily restricted. Cloud providers are in charge of physical access to these systems. \n\nMake sure your cloud provider is PCI-DSS compliant and follows this requirement. AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are all PCI-DSS compliant and ensure that the physical medium is protected.   \n\n#### 10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data. \n\nImplement logging and monitoring and track the logs in order to identify any suspicious behavior. Some examples of controls that ensure you have logging implemented are: \n\n* *Ensure AWS Config is enabled in all regions* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Auditing' is set to 'On'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n#### 11. Regularly test security systems and processes. \n\nUse applications and scanners to find vulnerabilities, malware, and other abnormalities in your systems. In addition, PCI-DSS guidelines recommend performing penetration testing on the infrastructure and applications. \n\n#### 12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel. \n\nEnsure that your staff is aware of security best practices and is regularly trained.  \n\nImplement strong policies to keep malicious entities away from your company and your customer’s data. \n\nSome controls that help you implement this requirement are: \n\n* *Ensure no \"root\" user account access key exists* for AWS \n* *Ensure that 'Notify about alerts with the following severity' is set to 'High'* for Microsoft Azure \n\n \n\nThese requirements can be implemented in no time using Cyscale controls and the steps described in them. \n\nBelow, you can see a small part of the PCI-DSS standard page from the Cyscale platform, along with the first two requirements from the list we’ve discussed. \n\n![The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale](/img/1.png#shadow \"The PCI-DSS page in Cyscale\")\n\nWe see a description and the controls necessary to ensure compliance by expanding the first requirement. The controls also contain steps on how to implement them. \n\n![The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale](/img/2.png#shadow \"The first requirement in PCI-DSS in Cyscale\")\n\n## Compliance levels \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/a-guide-to-the-4-pci-dss-compliance-levels), PCI-DSS has 4 levels of compliance, corresponding to the number of transactions processed by a company.  \n\nThe following [compliance](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) levels apply: \n\n* **Level 1:** over 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 2:** between 1 – 6 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 3:** between 20.000 – 1 million transactions annually, \n* **Level 4:** less than 20.000 transactions annually. \n\nBased on these levels, reporting and auditing differ.  \n\nAn audit is required once a year for all levels of PCI-DSS compliance, with different requirements: \n\n* a level 1 audit is performed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Internal Security Assessor (ISA), \n* an audit for levels 2, 3, and 4 can be completed with a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (QSA), \n* for level 1 and level 2 compliance, a Report of Compliance (RoC) must also be submitted to the acquiring bank. \n\n## Make this process easier for yourself \n\nConsidering the requirements presented in this article, it is not an easy task to become PCI-DSS compliant and obtain the certification. \n\nUse Cyscale in order to make sure you: \n\n* are correctly implementing technical requirements, \n* can demonstrate that your company is compliant. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find over 100 controls that will ensure PCI-DSS compliance and over 400 controls that will help you secure your cloud infrastructure and achieve compliance with other international standards, like GDPR, [ISO 27001, SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/), and many others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

PII can be used with or without other data to identify an individual. \n\nExamples of Personally Identifiable Information are: \n\n* name, \n* social security number, \n* biometric records, \n* unique personal document numbers such as passport or driver’s license number, \n* medical, educational, financial history, and many others. \n\nPII information can be categorized into two parts: \n\n1. Linked information. This type of data can on its own single out an individual. \n2. Unlinked information. A person cannot be directly traced based on it, but if combined with another piece of information it could identify an individual. Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","seoTitle":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","description":"When looking into consolidating your data protection services, you may decide to implement SOC 2 or ISO 27001.

Regulatory bodies are part of the ecosystems as well, making sure that businesses are doing the best they can to protect fintech consumers.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to take a deeper look at the most important regulations for payment services (which is a large subset of fintech services) in Europe, trying to showcase the security requirements for the technology at the core of these businesses, its governance included.\n\nWe keep in mind that although the UK has left the European Union, they decided to adopt a great part of the regulation under their legislation as well.\n\n## The PSD2 Directive\n\nProbably the most important European regulation that impacts fintech is the PSD2 Directive. Developed by the European Parliament and the European Council, introduced in 2015, and enforced since 2018, it describes rules, rights and obligations of Payment Service Providers and the users of these services. In the next sections, we go through the structure of the document, emphasizing the articles that regulate the “tech” in “fintech”.\n\nIt starts with 113 points that set up the context for the regulation and then follows with 6 main sections (also called titles).\n\n### Scope\n\n**The first section** clarifies the subject matter (who is affected), and that is Payment Service Providers. As we’ll see below, this includes traditional financial services providers, for example banks, but also new providers, such as fintechs. There’s also an article regarding scope: it applies to payment services provided within the European Union.\n\nPayment Service Providers are grouped under 6 distinct categories, but most fintechs fall under **payment institutions** and **electronic money institutions**.\n\nAny institution that provides payment services (enumerated below) after being authorized to do so, becomes a **payment institution**.\n\nThe different types of **payment services**, as understood from Annex 1 of the Directive are:\n\n-   operating a payment account for a user\n-   placing or withdrawing cash from a payment account\n-   payment transactions (i.e. transfers of funds) within the same provider, or to an external provider\n-   issuing of payment cards\n-   issuing sets of rules agreed between the issuer and the user that are then used to initiate a payment\n-   accepting and processing payment transactions\n-   money remittance, which is transfer of money without any payment accounts being created or used (think Western Union)\n-   payment initiation — initiate payment orders on behalf of the user (with his previous consent), from a payment account that is held at a different provider. This is possible due to the open banking framework.\n-   account information — provides information on payment accounts held by the user at a different provider. Again, this service has been made possible through open banking.\n\nAn **electronic money institution** is a legal entity that is authorized to issue electronic money. An electronic money institution can at the same time be a payment institution. There is a specific authorization license for each of these types of providers.\n\n### Becoming a PSP\n\n**The second section**, or title, adds further provisions for Payment Service Providers, including the procedure to become licensed as one.\n\n_Article 5_, titled “Applications for authorization”, contains the list of artefacts to submit when applying to become a payment institution. Among these, the directive requires **a security policy document** that must contain \"a detailed risk assessment\", along with the \"security control and mitigation measures taken\" to protect users against identified risk. It also explicitly states that the policy must indicate how the institution ensures \"a high level of **technical security and data protection**, including of the software and IT systems used\", and even when these are entirely or partly outsourced.\n\nAs we can see, already during the application process, a fintech business must have technical security controls in-place, as well as ways to describe them.\n\n**The third section** (title) of the directive refers to the transparency of conditions, as well as information requirements for payment service providers, meaning data regarding the payments which must be communicated to the service user at specific points in time. It does not contain any requirements for tech.\n\n### Proper Security\n\n**The fourth section** (title) details the rights and obligations around the provision and use of payment services, of both the providers and the users. This section is again relevant for those in charge of technology inside fintech companies providing payment services.\n\n*Article 66* and *Article 67* describe the obligations of PISPs (Payment Initiation Service Providers) and AISPs (Account Information Service Providers), which are both types of payment service providers.\n\nAn example of a PISP would be an application that, based on previously given user consent, makes regular (i.e. monthly) payments from the user’s bank account, and invests those funds on behalf of the user. In other words, by providing payment initiation services, the app makes payment transactions without the user having to do anything.\n\nTo understand an AISP, think of an application that queries information about a user’s bank account and then analyzes that data in order to give the user insights about his financial behavior. Previously given user consent is, of course, mandatory.\n\nUnder PSD2, the PISP and the AISP must:\n\n-   Protect user's personalized security credentials (PSC), if used, by transmitting them safely, and making sure they are not shared with other parties.\n\n    **PSCs** are, for example, your internet banking password, the code you use to authenticate to your neobank's mobile app, or any other means of authenticating with a Payment Service Provider. These credentials should not be shared with a PISP, or, when they are, they must be handled securely.\n\n-   Ensure that any information received about the payment service user is only provided to the payee (with user consent)\n-   When communicating with the entity that provides the user's payment account (i.e the bank), use common and secure open standards of communication\n-   Not store sensitive payment data of the user\n-   Not request from the user data that is not needed, in order to provide the services\n-   Not use, access, or store any user data for purposes other than the provided service\n-   In case of payment transactions, not modify the transaction amount\n\n*Article 70* states the obligations of a Payment Service Provider in relation to payment instruments (remember, these may be payment cards, but also procedures agreed between the user and the service provider on how to initiate payment orders). Again, the protection of personalized security credentials is required, by making sure that they are not accessible to other parties.\n\n*Article 74* states that when a Payment Service Provider doesn’t enforce strong customer authentication (**SCA**; think MFA) to protect transactions, it is liable for any financial losses incurred by the payer because of that.\n\n*Article 89* details the liability of Payment Service Providers in case they fail to correctly and in-time execute payment transactions. This part stresses out the importance of a solid **business continuity policy** and plan.\n\n*Article 95* requires two things from the Payment Service Providers:\n\n-   mitigation measures and control mechanisms in place, to manage operational and security risks\n-   to regularly provide operational and security risk assessments to competent authorities, as well as evidence that mitigation measures are adequate\n\n_Article 97_ requires from the PSP the implementation of strong customer authentication, meaning multi-factor authentication, involving something the user knows, something the user possesses or something that the user is (knowledge, possession or inherence). It also requires that “payment service providers have in place adequate security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of payment service users’ personalized security credentials”.\n\n### Ending Notes\n\nFinally, *Article 98* requires that, by July 2017, the Euro Bank Association (which is another EU institution) will have drafted regulatory technical standards to address the security requirements from previous articles (strong customer authentication and protecting the users’ personalized security credentials).\n\nThe **last two sections** refer to procedures for the settlement of disputes, user information rights, and final provisions, respectively, but neither of them contains additional technical requirements.\n\nThe regulatory technical standards developed by the EBA will be the subject of the next article in the series, where we will take a deeper dive into what they mean for a fintech.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"The ISO 27001 certification, policy by policy","seoTitle":null,"description":"Going through an ISO 27001 implementation means that people in your company must work closely together towards that end, as most everyone will need to be involved in the process at one stage or the other.

This marks the beginning of an empowering, although intimidating journey.\n\n**Why empowering?**\n\nGoing through an ISO 27001 implementation means that people in your company must work closely together towards that end, as most everyone will need to be involved in the process at one stage or the other. Across departments, team members will have to question their processes and their day-to-day work to make sure they are doing the right thing in the right way from a security perspective. Some things may need to change, which means that employees will have to take part in security awareness training sessions. Others will be involved in evidence collection: can your company prove that it is operating securely? One thing's for sure: everyone in the company will have to CARE. It is empowering and meaningful to care about your place of work and the people you serve as a business.\n\n**Why intimidating?**\n\nIf you've never dealt with regulatory standards before, you might find the text hard to distill in terms of “to-do items\" — it's not necessarily vague, but not that specific either. Its purpose is to offer guidelines that are general enough to encompass the particularities of each organization. The standard references quite a few documents that the company may need to create from scratch and then adhere to. On top of it all, the entire process ends with an audit, which means that an external entity will analyze your work and judge its value.\n\n**There's help out there!**\n\nThere are many comprehensive resources available regarding ISO implementation, and all of them will point to documents that need to be created — be it policies, procedures, or other lists and registers. It's important to understand that some of them will be mandatory for ANY organization getting certified, while others will be mandatory only for some, depending on identified risks. Keep in mind that some of these policies might exist in your organization even before considering implementing the standard.\n\nBelow is the list of documents that any organization must create:\n\n-   ISMS scope document (cl. 4.3)\n-   Information Security Policy (cl. 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2)\n    -   defines how security objectives will be set, and it may include the objectives themselves\n    -   should include roles and responsibilities\n-   Risk assessment process definition (cl. 6.1.2)\n    -   describes how risk assessment is done\n-   Statement of Applicability (cl. 6.1.3)\n    -   for each control from the Annex, the company must state whether it applies to them or not\n-   Risk treatment process (cl. 6.1.3)\n    -   describes how addressing risk is done\n\nThen there will be the documented results of performing certain actions:\n\n-   Risk assessment results - performed regularly (cl. 8.2)\n    -   contains the results of the risk assessment\n-   Risk treatment plan - performed regularly (cl. 6.1.3, cl. 8.3)\n    -   contains the plan to address identified risk\n-   Evidence of competence of persons doing work that affects information security performance (cl 7.20)\n-   Evidence of monitoring and measurement results (cl 9.1)\n-   Evidence of audit results (9.2)\n-   Evidence of the results of management reviews (9.3)\n-   Evidence of nonconformities encountered and subsequent actions taken; evidence of the results of any corrective action (cl 10.1)\n\n\\\n**And then there's the Annex**\n\nThe risks identified during risk assessment can and should be addressed with controls provided by the Standard in Annex A. As some of these controls mandate that other policies, procedures, or documents are created, we can conclude that these will only be required when they help mitigate an identified risk. These additional documents are:\n\n-   Mobile device policy (A.6.2.1)\n-   Teleworking (Remote working) policy (A.6.2.2)\n-   Disciplinary process (A.7.2.3)\n-   Inventory of assets (A.8.1.1)\n-   Acceptable use of assets (A.8.1.3)\n-   Information labeling policy (A.8.2.2)\n-   Handling assets policy (A.8.2.3)\n-   Management of removable media policy (including disposal of media) (A.8.3.1)\n-   Access control policy (A.9.1.1)\n-   User access management policy (A.9.2.1, A.9.2.2, A.9.2.4)\n-   Use of cryptographic controls policy (A.10.1.1)\n-   Use, protection and lifetime of cryptographic keys (A.10.1.2)\n-   Working in secure areas (A.11.1.5)\n-   Clear desk and clear screen policy (A.11.2.9)\n-   Operating procedures (A.12.1.1)\n-   Backup policy (A.12.3.1)\n-   Installation of software policy (A.12.5.1)\n-   Information transfer policy (A.13.2.1)\n-   Secure development policy (A.14.2.1)\n-   Change control procedures (A.14.2.2)\n-   Secure systems engineering policy(A.14.2.5)\n-   IS Policy for supplier relationships (A.15.1.1)\n-   Information Security incidents response policy (A.16.1.1, A.16.1.5)\n-   Information security continuity policy (A.17.1.2)\n-   Legislation and contractual requirements (A.18.1.1)\n-   IP (A.18.1.2)\n\nIf you're a company that's just beginning to consider developing an ISMS and getting certified, you might need help creating some or all of these documents. Cyscale offers quite a few of them out-of-the-box, giving you the possibility to use them as templates and add customizations to your needs, or to just use them as they are.\n\n[Easy & continuous compliance for ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), with a set of battle-tested policies to jumpstart your ISMS\n\n_Photo by Scott Graham_\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Bridging the Gap Between ISO 27001 and Cloud-Native Systems","seoTitle":null,"description":"Being compliant is a huge selling point and many well-established customers will even require this from their service providers.

Or at least not entirely.\n\nThe trend over the past few years has been clear: shift left. The idea is to identify and prevent issues (not only security-related) as soon as possible. This implies more collaboration during the day-to-day development and even mixed teams that handle all the aspects of the product (there is no limit to how many words we can fit between “Dev” and “Ops”).\n\nWhile some might be inclined to believe organizations are doing this just to cut down costs (of course this is one of the reasons and it should be), the reality is that the team that builds the product also knows the product best. A virtual machine that can theoretically be accessed on port 22 (SSH) from any IP might mean a security hazard to someone that sees the system for the first time. On the other hand, the team will probably have more context and will be able to provide a more accurate risk assessment - maybe the VM is not actually accessible over the internet because it's deployed in a private subnet. Context matters.\n\nAnd the truth is that most teams will happily take on more responsibility and/or collaborate closely with their colleagues. Actually, the best teams want and demand this. They want to contribute to the architecture of the product, be involved in the risk assessments, and help with sales. They will gladly do this as long as the **purpose is clear** and **the job involves actually building something** (this is what software engineers refer to as fun).\n\nOn the other hand, pursuing something like compliance with ISO 27001 which involves reading and writing a lot, might be met with some resistance. While some might get “fooled” when being told they will **build** an Information Security Management **System** (**ISMS** from now on), most people will stop listening when they hear compliance (are you still reading this?). But it doesn't have to be like this.\n\nBeing compliant is a huge selling point and many well-established customers will even require this from their service providers. One missing product feature will probably not make or break the deal, but missing compliance will.\n\n## The Standard\n\nThe ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard is targeted towards information security. It guides us in the process of building an ISMS that takes a holistic approach (i.e. look at the facts from multiple perspectives) to achieve better **confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our assets (i.e. reduce risks)**.\n\nSince it can be applied in a wide range of industries and companies, ISO 27001 provides general recommendations and approaches. It doesn't tell us how to do anything and there is no recipe for success. **Looking through a simplified view, ISO 27001 guides us through our journey of discovering our assets, identifying risks, and devising strategies for eliminating, mitigating, and remediating the relevant risks.** These can go from ensuring we use encryption to having a designated responsible for contacting authorities when bad things happen (and they will happen).\n\nSo basically it helps us document how we protect our assets. Now, these assets can be anything from physical devices (e.g. laptops) to data stored in an S3 bucket. The standard covers all kinds of assets and situations such as a new employee joining the company (how are they assigned access? have we performed the relevant background checks?) or segregating our networks based on users and services.\n\nIn fact, ISO 27001 provides 114 controls structured in 14 sections (called clauses), each covering a specific area. For example, clause A.13 refers to communications security and has two objectives:\n\n-   Network security management\n-   Information transfer\n\nBoth objectives contain several so-called **controls** that aim to help us **reduce the risk** when applicable. One of the controls, A.13.2.3, refers to _Electronic messaging_ and says the following:\n\n_Information involved in electronic messaging shall be appropriately protected._\n\nThe control tells us what should be achieved, but doesn't tell us how. This is where the compliance team and the development team (usually represented by the architect) start gathering information. Their duty is to research the options and possibilities they have and to find out how the system/application handles it currently.\n\n### Translating ISO controls to the cloud\n\nAssuming they are building their software on top of a hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), they might start by enforcing HTTPS traffic through security groups/firewalls and leveraging private subnets. This should be good enough for virtual machines, but their applications might use more services such as object storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS), load balancers, managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, the Azure SQL suite of services), integration services such as queueing and pub/sub systems, and the list goes on and on (and probably got longer while you were reading this article).\n\nAfter 6 days of research, they might have identified the following options, let's say on AWS:\n\n1. Since they have been using AWS for the past 9 years, they have to make sure all their EC2 instances are migrated and deployed in a VPC, as opposed to EC2-Classic.\n2. The security groups attached to the load balancers should allow traffic only on port 443.\n3. The load balancers should have TLS listeners set up and accept only safe cipher suites - e.g. it shouldn't accept TLS 1.0 or older SSL protocols that are considered unsafe.\n4. The security groups attached to virtual machines running the application should only accept traffic from the load balancer.\n5. Self-hosted databases such as Elasticsearch should only accept traffic from the EC2 instances running the application.\n6. RDS instances should not be publicly accessible and should only accept traffic from the same EC2 instances.\n7. S3 buckets should have a bucket policy that enforces HTTPS.\n8. S3 buckets should not allow public access through the bucket policy or the ACL (some buckets are pretty old so they heavily rely on ACLs).\n9. And finally, since they leverage AMIs, they would like to ensure that these are private.\n\nCovering all these should provide a great starting point to ensure electronic messaging security. The compliance team adds them to the policy (remember, the output of ISO 27001 is an ISMS which is a set of policies), the development team configures the infrastructure, and the target is achieved. Or is it?\n\n### If it hurts, do it more often\n\n**Adopting a standard means setting a new bar**. It means that all changes from now on must respect the new rules. Of course, the development team is unlikely to print the security policies and attach them to their wall so the product owner creates tasks with checklists as part of their stories. Everything is great now. Every time they add a new cloud resource all they have to do is to go through a 235 items checklist. And also they have to add the resource to their asset inventory.\n\nBeing smart engineers, the development team decides to use AWS Config and implement custom rules to perform these checks whenever a resource is changed. They plan to implement this over the next 4 months and try to keep the compliance team in the loop because they don't want to deal with a stack of Word documents (even though they represent the heart and soul of the compliance team).\n\nNow, if your organization is at this point, you adopted the DevOps culture at this level and you have all these resources, you will probably be fine. Of course, you will have to:\n\n1. practically spam all your employees with presentations about the policies\n2. train and retrain everyone involved including every new employee\n3. wonder whether anyone has actually ever read the policies\n4. wonder whether your research was comprehensive enough\n5. oppose adopting any new cloud provider because it would mean implementing and mapping all the controls again and again\n\n**However, if this sounds like a lot of work to do and/or you want to take your [ISO 27001 Compliance & Cloud Security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) to the next level by giving power to your policies and ultimately to your people, check out [cyscale.com](https://app.cyscale.com/ 'https://app.cyscale.com/').**\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":9,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2,"category":"Compliance","seoTitle":"Cyscale - Compliance","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale Compliance","categoriesList":["CNAPP","Product","CSPM","News","Compliance","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3325979619","3765828210","4109069157"]}
