It is easy to overlook even the smallest configuration and introduce a vulnerability in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nIn this article, you will find a comprehensive guide that will help you understand possible misconfigurations in your AWS cloud infrastructure and how to remediate them.  \n\n## Steps to secure your cloud environment \n\n### 1. Data classification \n\n[Classifying your cloud data](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) can help you easily sort, retrieve, and prioritize it. This is done using a tag (sometimes called a label), which is applied to cloud storage assets. In this way, that data is placed into one or more categories and can be identified more easily. \n\nBenefits of data classification include: \n\n* Risk management, \n* Compliance,  \n* Security. \n\nIn AWS, tags are key-value pairs that add metadata to your data. \n\nThe AWS documentation recommends using a three-tiered approach, with the following tags: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official,  \n* Secret. \n\nHowever, users can tailor data classification to their needs and use their own tags. In addition, **tag policies** can be used to standardize their creation and ensure consistency across all assets. \n\nTo accomplish classification using tags in your AWS environment, you have the following options: \n\n* Using the Amazon console, at resource level, where tags can be added either at creation or after, \n* Programmatically, using the Amazon API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. \n\nAccording to the AWS documentation, restrictions regarding tags include: \n\n* There cannot be more than 50 tags per resource, \n* Each tag key must be unique for each resource, \n* The maximum key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8, \n* The maximum value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. \n\n### 2. Encryption \n\nEncryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality because entities that do not have the decryption key cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, cannot read its content. \n\nThe two types of encryption mechanisms are: \n\n* **Symmetric encryption**, where the encryption and the decryption key are the same, and \n* **Asymmetric encryption**, where the two keys are different; one is called public key and the other private key. \n\nEncryption can be done in all three states of data: \n\n* [At rest,](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) \n* In transit, \n* In use. \n\nIn this article, we will discuss data encryption in the first two states, but [a more detailed article](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) regarding encryption also describes encryption in the last state of data. \n\nFor data in transit, AWS provides the following solution: \n\n1. Encrypt the data using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n2. Perform client-side encryption. This solution requires the user to encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud, but it is more difficult since the client has to deal with the encryption process, key management, and other services. \n\nFor data at rest, AWS provides encryption for the following services:  \n\n* Amazon EBS,  \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift,  \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nAWS uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm, an industry-recommended standard and one of the strongest algorithms for symmetric encryption. \n\nKey management is also a very important element of data encryption. If your keys are not stored safely, then no matter how strong the encryption algorithm is, a malicious party may be able to read your data. \n\nA few best practices regarding encryption keys are: \n\n* Do not store your keys in the same place as your data or in the source code, \n* Rotate and retire keys regularly to minimize the impact of a breach, \n* Manage key deletion, \n* Use Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs) to generate your keys. \n\nAWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) is a comprehensive solution that helps users deal with all the trouble that comes with cryptographic keys. \n\nAWS KMS helps you: \n\n* Create cryptographic keys, \n* Define policies and control how the keys are used, \n* Audit the keys usage to ensure they are used legitimately. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used: \n\n1. Through the AWS Management Console, \n2. Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### 3. Access control \n\nRegulating access control is an essential step to your [cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) program.  \n\nTo manage access control in AWS, you can use policies, which can be assigned at the following levels: \n\n* Users, \n* Groups of users, \n* Roles, \n* Resources. \n\nPolicies define permissions. To correctly implement them, use the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) to only allow access rights to the necessary users for the minimum amount of time possible.  \n\nLet’s look at an example where a policy is applied to a resource.  \n\nAn AWS S3 bucket is a type of asset used to store object-like data such as files, databases, and other unstructured data. \n\nA bucket policy contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied and is written in JSON.  \n\n```jsonld\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"S3PolicyId1\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\",\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"NotIpAddress\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*Policy source – docs.aws.amazon.com* \n\nAnalyzing the image above, we understand that the policy is applied to a bucket resource, the rule for the permission is “Deny”, and the result of the bucket policy is denying access to the objects stored in the specified bucket unless the requests are made with source IPs in the subnet 54.240.143.0/24. \n\n### 4. Data loss prevention \n\nData loss prevention (DLP) is a protection mechanism for sensitive data that ensures that no unintentional or malicious disclosures occur. DLP prevents data breaches by ensuring no confidential data is accidentally leaked, lost, or stolen. \n\n**Amazon Macie** is a data security and privacy service that protects users’ sensitive data using machine learning technologies and pattern matching. \n\nThis tool identifies sensitive data using **sensitive data discovery jobs**, which analyze S3 buckets. Sensitive data discovery jobs use pre-defined or user-defined lists (or a combination of both) to single out confidential data by matching patterns to the lists. \n\nA passport number is an example of sensitive data that Amazon Macie could match. This is because it has a set number of digits, some corresponding to the owner's region or country. \n\nAfter identifying sensitive data, Amazon Macie can: \n\n* use IAM policies to filter traffic to it,  \n* encrypt and decrypt data,  \n* perform logging and monitoring through AWS CloudTrail integration, and others.  \n\n### 5. Availability \n\nAvailability means that users should be able to access their data without disruptions at any point. \n\nA solution for availability in the cloud is **availability zones**. \n\nAn availability zone is a geographical area where groups of data centers are located. These data centers contain replicated data and provide redundancy regarding electrical power, networking, and connectivity. \n\nAn AWS region contains multiple AWS availability zones, all within 100km of each other, which are independent and provide redundancy. \n\nSome AWS regions around the globe are: \n\n* North America,  \n* South America, \n* Europe,  \n* China,  \n* South Africa, and others. \n\nThese regions provide high availability. \n\nAnother solution for availability is DDoS Protection. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are attempts to bring down a service or a resource by sending a large amount of traffic to them using controlled machines. \n\nAWS Shield is the AWS DDoS Protection service that protects applications hosted in the cloud. \n\nAWS Shield has two tiers: \n\n* Standard, \n* Advanced. \n\nBesides the features that come with the Standard plan, which are at network and transport layer, the Advanced tier of AWS Shield provides: \n\n* integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* real-time visibility into attacks,  \n* additional detection and mitigation of sophisticated DDOS attacks, and others. \n\n## Secure your cloud environment \n\nAfter understanding the security demands required for the cloud, implementing them seems like a daunting task. However, using Cyscale, you can easily check if you’re lacking any of the mentioned implementations and remediate any findings. \n\nCyscale has over 400 controls that cover a large variety of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and offer support not only for AWS, but for Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud as well. \n\n\n\nEnhance your AWS cloud data security with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/) to automate the contextual analysis of misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, access, and data for an accurate risk assessment.

It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers: \n\n* Real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, \n* A comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, \n* An overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, \n* Remediation solutions for findings, and many others. \n\nA CSPM is a solution that modern security teams use to proactively identify and fix security issues in their cloud infrastructure to ensure a strong security posture in the cloud. \n\n## A day in the life with CSPM \n\nWhat does a day in the life of a cloud security professional using a CSPM look like? First of all, we must see what it was like *before adopting a CSPM tool*. \n\nFrom manual security checks that take hours, to identifying and fixing compliance gaps, professionals may experience pressure in trying to secure the entire cloud environment. \n\nWith a CSPM, a cloud security team member can be more efficient. They may follow this workflow: \n\n1. The day starts by looking at open alerts and prioritizing the most important and impactful fixes. Using the remediation guidelines provided by the CSPM solution, they would solve some of the issues; \n2. The next step would be researching and understanding how to solve more complex problems identified by the CSPM: by looking at diagrams and dashboards, the user would gain enhanced visibility on how cloud resources are configured and relate to one another; \n3. If the company is going through an audit for a standard, such as ISO 27001 or PCI-DSS, they would assist their compliance colleagues with proper reporting and fixing any existing gaps; a low compliance score highlighted by the CSPM would indicate on which specific area they and the compliance team should focus on to improve the score. \n\nNow, using a comprehensive CSPM solution, confidence and control are gained. Notice how the cloud security professional is no longer spending time on security checks, but rather on actions that have an impact over the company’s cloud security posture. \n\nA CSPM tool has the following capabilities: \n\n### 1. Misconfigurations checks automation \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nOne common way in which scans are performed is controls. Security controls are based on recommendations and best practices; through them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nSome examples of common misconfigurations a CSPM looks for are: \n\n* An S3 bucket that should not be publicly accessible is, and anyone has READ or WRITE permissions on it, \n* The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port for a VM is open and can be accessed from the Internet, \n* Logging is disabled for cloud resources, thus unauthorized access cannot be detected. \n\nControls are among the most significant features you can find in a CSPM solution. Controls are based on security recommendations and best practices; using them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: from databases to buckets, from security groups to web applications, they cover a wide range of configurations and the result of using them surpasses any manual work that could be done. \n\n### 2. A robust alert system  \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nA good alert system can make a difference by reducing or eliminating false positives, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, and enabling understanding by adding context to findings. In this way, detected security issues are solved quickly, and *[alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/)* is avoided.  \n\nMoreover, a CSPM solution has integration with notification channels and ticketing systems to notify its users of findings. This feature is very useful for security teams because it streamlines the process and allows them to view urgent problems directly in the apps they use, such as Slack or Jira. \n\n### 3. Contextual visibility \n\nWithout proper visibility, a cloud security professional that intends to apply security best practices might do so in places with low impact, while higher risk items remain unaddressed. \n\nFor example, a company may have a VM running an application with a Log4Shell vulnerability, and multiple Internet-facing cloud resources that have less critical vulnerabilities. The VM may be prioritized because this type of vulnerability is severe and well-known. However, if that VM runs on a private network and is not accessible from the Internet, then the prioritization is not ideal, and Internet-facing applications and devices are neglected. \n\n### 4. Remediation steps \n\nA good CSPM solution aids security teams in their process of securing a cloud environment. \n\nDetailed remediation steps do not miss from CSPM software. Recommendations on how to fix findings include: \n\n* A series of actions a cloud security professional must execute in order to solve the identified problem, \n* A set of commands that fix the found issue, that can be used in a command line, \n* Recommended reading materials that could help the cloud security professional understand the problem on a deeper level and avoid it in the future. \n\n### 5. Compliance aid \n\nA company that seeks to achieve compliance with a certain standard or regulation must face a long and tedious journey, because this usually entails reviewing organizational, as well as technology-related practices, producing a lot of documentation in the form of policies and procedures, and ultimately ensuring that any system that comes in contact with customer data has appropriate security controls in place.  \n\nA CSPM tool eases this process by measuring the cloud security posture against the required state and providing compliance scoring. Moreover, after passing an audit, CSPMs can help companies stay compliant and ensure they’re following all security recommendations. \n\n### 6. Multi-cloud coverage \n\nWith CSPMs, you don’t need to monitor your infrastructure in a different place for each cloud service provider you’re using; CSPM tools are *[multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/)*! By covering Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, your entire technology stack in the cloud is secured by CSPMs. You can monitor and secure all of your cloud environments in one single platform. Moreover, you can define security policies in your CSPM tool and apply them across all cloud infrastructures. \n\nIn addition to analyzing security for cloud providers, some CSPMs offer additional types of integrations, such as those with identity providers. \n\nBy taking a proactive stance on cloud security posture, IT professionals can benefit from the power of a CSPM solution and ensure that their organization’s cloud infrastructure is resilient against emerging threats. \n\n### CSPM in Action - Real Life Case Studies \n\nCyscale is a [CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using powerful dashboards and security controls, saving teams considerable time on remediation.

ECS enables users to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.  \n\nIn this article, we will explore:  \n\n* what ECS is,  \n* how it works,  \n* common vulnerabilities, and most importantly,  \n* container security best practices to maximize cybersecurity on the ECS platform. \n\n## Understanding Amazon ECS \n\nAmazon ECS is a container orchestration service that simplifies the deployment and management of containers on AWS. It allows you to run containers at scale without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nECS provides the flexibility to choose between two launch types: EC2 and Fargate. With the EC2 launch type, containers are run on EC2 instances that you have to manage, while with Fargate, AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you only focus on deploying and scaling containers. \n\n## What is Amazon ECS used for? \n\nECS is a service suitable for a wide range of use cases, such as \n\n* **microservices architecture**: ECS enables you to break down your application into smaller, independently deployable microservices, facilitating scalability and flexibility. \n* **batch processing**: ECS simplifies the execution of batch workloads by running containers in parallel, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing processing time. \n* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: With ECS, you can build an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying containerized applications, ensuring faster and efficient software delivery. \n* **web applications**: ECS is ideal for hosting web apps, providing automatic scaling capabilities, load balancing, and seamless integration with other AWS services. \n\n## Common Vulnerabilities \n\nWhile ECS provides a robust container management framework, it's crucial to be aware of common vulnerabilities that can impact containerized apps: \n\n* **Inadequate IAM permissions**: Misconfigured AWS IAM roles and policies can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within ECS. \n* **Vulnerable container images**: Using outdated or insecure container images that contain known security vulnerabilities can expose applications to exploitation and malware. \n* **Weak network security**: Misconfigured security groups, improper network isolation, or exposure of unnecessary ports are a few examples that can lead to unauthorized access to containers or sensitive data. \n* **Lack of logging and monitoring**: Insufficient monitoring and logging of ECS services can make detecting and responding to security incidents challenging. \n\n## Best practices for containers security on ECS \n\nSecure your production environments and improve your cloud security posture by following the best practices described in this article. \n\n### 1. Implement IAM best practices\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege by assigning granular IAM roles to ECS tasks and services. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and follow AWS security best practices. Enforce strong password rules to ensure secure authentication. \n\n### 2. Secure container images \n\nUtilize secure container base images from trusted sources. Perform regular image scanning for new vulnerabilities and update container images. Leverage Dockerfile best practices to create secure and efficient Docker container images. \n\n### 3. Configure network security \n\nLeverage security groups and network ACLs to enforce fine-grained network traffic access controls for ECS containers. Only expose necessary ports and protocols, and use encryption for data in transit. Implement network segmentation by allowing connectivity only between the containers that truly need it and isolating the rest. Utilize Kubernetes network security policies to control the traffic between containers. Avoid using public IP addresses for ECS instances to prevent unintended access to your app servers. \n\n### 4. Enable logging and monitoring\n\nEnable detailed logging for ECS services and applications. Utilize AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize logs for monitoring and analysis and turn on Container Insights for your ECS clusters. Continuous monitoring can help you identify security issues at container runtime. \n\n### 5. Manage dependencies and vulnerabilities \n\nRegularly update and patch the host operating system and other software dependencies used within your container images. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in your containerized applications. If you’re using Fargate, ensure the services are running on the latest Fargate platform version; new updates come with security patches and bug fixes.  \n\n### 6. Do not run containers as the root user \n\nRunning containers with high privileges can increase the attack surface by allowing attackers to take advantage of this misconfiguration and “escape” the containers, obtaining high privileges on the host virtual machine. This breaks the isolation of containers. Run your ECS containers as non-privileged by setting the *privileged* parameter in the container definition to *false*. \n\nMitigate security risks by implementing the recommended best practices and secure your container environment. \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale provides a Containers dashboard, where you can see what assets are using them and other details about containers, as well as controls that check for ECS misconfigurations and provide alerting and remediation steps to fix findings in no time.  \n\nSome examples of security controls that you can find on the Cyscale platform are: \n\n* *Ensure ECS services don't have public IP addresses assigned to them automatically*\n* *Ensure ECS clusters use Container Insights*\n* *Ensure ECS containers run as non-privileged*\n* *Ensure ECS containers are limited to read-only access to root filesystems*\n\n\n\nCyscale - Your Trusted [Cloud Security Company](https://cyscale.com): \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale offers a comprehensive Cloud Security Platform.

Containers are a lightweight solution that allows applications to run independently of operating systems. Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies and provide numerous benefits, such as: \n\n* **Portability.** Because containers encapsulate everything needed to run applications, they can be moved between environments without causing the need for additional libraries or other tools. \n* **Consistency.** By including all the needed dependencies in a container image, an app will work the same across different machines; no more \"it works on my machine\". \n* **Scalability.** By leveraging container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, you can dynamically scale containers based on demand, allowing your application to handle varying workloads effectively. \n* **Isolation.** Since the app has its own environment, it is isolated from other resources. This adds a layer of security.  \n\n## Container images vulnerabilities \n\nContainers have many advantages. However, they can also introduce unique vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure. Let’s look at some of them to fully understand the impact of using containerization. \n\n### 1. Vulnerable libraries. \n\nContainer images often contain third-party libraries and dependencies. It is not uncommon for libraries to have known vulnerabilities.  \n\nRegularly scanning and updating these dependencies is critical to reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Insecure configurations \n\nMisconfigured container images can lead to the compromise of confidentiality of data, unauthorized access, and others. Examples of insecure settings include: \n\n* Weak access control, \n* The usage of environment variables to pass sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys), \n* Poor network settings, such as unnecessary open ports. \n\n### 3. Outdated software \n\nContainer images may contain outdated frameworks, operating systems, and libraries. If they are not regularly updated, they may have vulnerabilities. Run your applications on updated OSs and use newer versions of frameworks and libraries to ensure that your infrastructure is patched! \n\n## Common best practices \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of best practices that you should follow when using container images or when creating them: \n\n1. ### Ensure visibility in your cloud environment \n\nContainers are widely used in cloud environments due to their scalability and efficiency. To understand how container images affect your security posture, you need to gain visibility in your cloud infrastructure and grasp the context of every image in use by: \n\n* mapping cloud resources to the images they’re using, \n* identifying which of those assets have access to critical data, \n* assessing the container image configurations. \n\n2. ### Use trusted base images \n\nOnly utilize trusted images from known, reputable sources to ensure that the container images you're using are patched and have undergone security reviews. These images are not guaranteed to be completely secure, but it's a good starting point. \n\n3. ### Perform regular updates \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, patch container images to avoid the use of outdated or vulnerable frameworks, libraries or operating systems.  \n\n4. ### Scan your container images for vulnerabilities \n\nScan images regularly for known vulnerabilities and make sure to address any findings. Reduce the attack surface and obtain insights into vulnerabilities present in the software components of a container image. \n\n5. ### Harden your container image \n\nReduce the attack surface of your containerized applications: \n\n1. Implement [the least privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege): do not run processes as root to prevent the possibility of privilege escalation inside your container. \n2. Disable unnecessary services and functionalities: minimize potential entry points for attackers by disabling tools that are not required. \n3. Restrict ports accessibility: do not leave networks ports open unnecessarily. \n\n## Container images – where are they present? \n\nContainer images can be used in various cloud-based services across public cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.  \n\nThese services leverage container images to enable the seamless deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. \n\nExamples of services that run container images are: \n\n* ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service), EKS (Amazon Kubernetes Service) \n* AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), \n* GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), and others. \n\n\n\nContainers form the foundation of modern cloud-based application deployment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand their purpose, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices for securing them. By implementing the recommended best practices and staying informed about emerging threats, your organization can secure container environments and ensure the safety of cloud-based applications. \n\nIn the dynamic landscape of cloud security, continuous learning and adaptation are paramount. As containerization continues to revolutionize the cloud industry, maintaining a strong focus on container image security will help organizations stay ahead of potential threats and safeguard their valuable assets.\n"}}],"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3058837307","3325979619","3765828210","4109069157"]}
