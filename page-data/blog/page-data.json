It was initially assigned a CVSS score of 9.1, which was increased to 10, the maximum, on November 6th.  \n\nThis is the [second critical vulnerability](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22515-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1295682276.html) in Atlassian Data Center and Server discovered in the same month, alongside CVE-2023-22515.   \n\n## Confluence Improper Authorization vulnerability in detail \n\nThis vulnerability occurs due to Improper Authorization. The bug enables the attacker to: \n\n* reset a Confluence instance, and to \n* create a Confluence instance administrator account. \n\nThis means the attacker can either reset the entire instance, causing the company to lose data unless it is backed up, or they can steal the data by creating an administrator account.   \n\n### What you need to do: mitigation of the Confluence Improper Authorization vulnerability \n\nSince all versions prior to the attack are affected, [Atlassian urges users](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html) to immediately patch to the new versions released:  \n\n* 7.19.16, \n* 8.3.4, \n* 8.4.4, \n* 8.5.3, \n* 8.6.1. \n\nIf patching is not possible straight away, remove the instance from being publicly accessible. This is a temporary measure that allows you to gain time by limiting the attack surface – if your instance is not Internet-facing, attackers cannot reach it as easily. \n\nBesides this, it is recommended to back-up your instance. \n\nIf you cannot patch the instance and remove it from the internet, you can apply the following temporary solutions, which you can also find on [Atlassian’s page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html): \n\nBlock access to the following endpoints: \n\n* /json/setup-restore.action \n* /json/setup-restore-local.action \n* /json/setup-restore-progress.action \n\nTo do that, on each node, modify /<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml and add the following block of code (just before the </web-app> tag at the end of the file): \n\n```\n\n<security-constraint>\n\t\t<web-resource-collection>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>\n\t\t</web-resource-collection>\n\t<auth-constraint />\n</security-constraint>\n```\n\nThen, restart your instance.   \n\n### How do you know if you were affected? \n\nIf you cannot login anymore, it could be a sign that your Confluence instance has been compromised. Besides this, look out for: \n\n* requests to /json/setup-restore* in your logs, \n* installed unknown plugins (the malicious plugin web.shell.Plugin was reported, according to Atlassian), \n* corrupted data or encrypted files that were not encrypted before, \n* new and unexpected members of the confluence-administrators group, \n* new and unexpected user accounts. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) surfaces assets affected by the Improper Authorization Vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Everything to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"HITRUST (Health Information Trust) Alliance is the organization that established the HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework), a framework for managing and securing information in the healthcare industry.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"High-severity Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","seoTitle":"Critical NGINX Ingress Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","description":"Three high-severity security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the NGINX Ingress controller for Kubernetes, which could put credentials and other secrets at risk of theft by threat actors.

These vulnerabilities have been assigned a CVSS score of 7.6 (the first two) and 8.6 (the third one), ranked HIGH. \n\nTo better understand how the vulnerabilities can be exploited, what the impact is on your cloud infrastructure and how they can be patched, let’s dive deeper: \n\n### What is an NGINX Ingress controller? \n\nThe ingress-NGINX controller is a [specialized load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) for Kubernetes and other containerized environments that accepts incoming traffic and routes it to Kubernetes pods. The NGINX Ingress controller is designed to be a central point of entry into a Kubernetes cluster adding a layer of abstraction to reduce routing complexity.  \n\nTo put it simply, it’s like a traffic policeman that tells all vehicles on a road where they are and are not allowed to go. \n\nAn ingress-NGINX controller is a specific implementation of an Ingress controller that uses the NGINX web server, which is known for its speed and efficiency.   \n\n### The 3 NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities in detail \n\n**CVE-2023-5043** \n\nAnnotations are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects in order to add additional information to those objects. \n\nDue to poor input sanitization, the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet can be used to inject command execution. \n\nThe “configuration-snippet” annotation, or metadata, allows users to inject custom configuration code into the NGINX configuration file. \n\n**CVE-2023-5044** \n\nThis vulnerability occurs for the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation. This annotation allows you to establish a permanent HTTP redirect (Return Code 301) by injecting arbitrary code via the annotation. As a result, the controller will redirect traffic to that path. \n\n**CVE-2022-4886** \n\nThis issue can be exploited by someone with create or update permissions on ingress API objects.   \n\nThe field spec.rules\\[].http.paths\\[].path allows you to specify where incoming requests to your applications should be routed based on the path in the URL. Since the input is not correctly sanitized, the attacker can specify an internal file as the path, obtaining the credentials of the controller. Thus, by exploiting the poor sanitization, the attacker gains access to sensitive data. \n\n### Impact of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nIngress controllers run with high privileges. By default, having access to the credentials of the ingress controller means you have access to all secrets in the cluster. As you can imagine, the impact of these vulnerabilities left unchecked can create significant risk for your data. So, it’s no surprise that the vulnerabilities described have been assigned such high CVSS scores.  \n\n### Mitigation of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nTo protect your cloud environment from these vulnerabilities, follow these steps: \n\n* for CVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044, update NGINX to version 1.19 and set the --enable-annotation-validation flag, \n* for CVE-2022-4886, change the pathType attribute of the controller to Exact or Prefix. This will allow only paths that start with “/” and contain alphanumeric characters, “-“, “_”, and additional “/”.  \n\n### The impact of NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities on cloud environments  \n\nThe next question is, are cloud environments impacted by these vulnerabilities? Yes! Many cloud environments run Kubernetes clusters with NGINX-ingress controllers. For a cloud-native company building software that heavily relies on Kubernetes and employs ingress-controllers, there are significant risks involved. If exploited, these bugs can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the cluster. \n\nMoreover, the ingress controller manages incoming traffic, so the disruption of such a critical component of an infrastructure can cause availability issues leading to downtime and possible financial losses. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) surfaces assets affected by the NGINX Ingress controller bugs as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant: Making Cloud Security More Intuitive","seoTitle":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant | Cyscale","description":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","seoDescription":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","date":"2023-11-02T13:00:05.768Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/blog-cover-ai-assistant.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/41be8/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/c78f7/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/913d0/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/91660/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/888e2/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"Cyscale, [the platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily,](https://cyscale.com/) is excited to give a first glimpse into the potential enabled by generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM),  unveiling our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question. \n\nAs engineers we’ve spent almost 20 years working with the cloud, and the complexity of cloud environments mean it’s now impossible to correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually to expose real risk, especially if you have a small team.  \n\nGenerating security alerts is not the problem. The problem is understanding them in context, and it's getting harder for a CTO or CISO to [prioritize remediation because of the volume of alerts](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/).   \n\nWe think context is king, and the value of Cyscale is in our application of graph technology to inventory all cloud assets and the relationships between those assets to [identify and prioritize real security threats](https://cyscale.com/blog/contextual-security-google-cloud/).   \n\nNow with developments in AI we are taking this value even further by enabling our platform to automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues using our customers’ cloud footprint combined with Large Language Models (LLM) of vulnerabilities and exploits.    \n\nIn our first look at Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant you can see how we’re making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\n## D﻿emonstration of Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant\n <br class=\"\" />\n \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/boWgsssdTDI?si=0IfNfAnUTRMWpvf8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe key value here is the democratization of cloud security. Regardless of your skill level, the Security Assistant connects all the dots between disparate information sources so you don’t have to. This means security practitioners struggling to keep up with technical tasks can get information that’s relevant to them, just the same as compliance officers can get information about security posture through a lens that’s more relevant to their interests.  \n\nThis example shows you just the very tip of what’s possible by asking the Assistant questions such as:  \n\n* Which security controls have failed?   \n* What are my top three vulnerabilities and their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score?  \n* How can I fix these vulnerabilities on their specific cloud platform?   \n\n## Democratizing cloud security with AI\n\nNot only does this approach help people in different functions (security, DevOps, compliance) get information that’s more contextually relevant to their role, it helps them perform tasks faster by giving links directly to the affected assets in question, and clear instructions on how to fix associated issues.   \n\nIt also helps security professionals navigate multi-cloud environments by abstracting the unique and different terminologies used from one cloud provider to another (‘termination’ versus ‘deallocation’ for example) into more natural language. \n\n> “Cybersecurity may have become cloud security, but it’s becoming less and less human friendly,” says Ovidiu Cical, Cyscale CEO. “It’s now impossible for a CTO, CISO, or security practitioner to stay on top of an endless list of alerts and things that need fixing without automation. Companies like us have made great strides in automating these processes and providing context but it’s still a lot of information for small teams to digest and act on.” \n>\n> “With these rapid developments in AI assistance we can help different kinds of people interact with our tools in a more natural and contextually relevant way. AI is actually making cloud security more human,” Ovidiu adds.   \n\nThis is important because [Gartner estimates that 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure), mainly through failures to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. Automation puts people back in control by helping them better manage cloud complexity, security, and compliance. \n\nCyscale’s Security Assistant is still in development, so stay tuned for more insights into the potential unlocked by AI, but existing customers and new prospects can request to have it added to their account for testing.  \n\n[B﻿ook a demo to see](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) it in action.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","seoTitle":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures due to failure to disclose significant cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities over at least a two-year period.

Moreover, they have routinely overstated their cybersecurity best practices and misled investors.  \n\nSEC’s complaint seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown”, SolarWinds’ CISO. \n\nSEC’s actions show that cybersecurity should be taken seriously and should include adequate prevention as well as remediation strategies, otherwise companies may face serious legal consequences.  \n\nIt is important to identify ongoing risks and apply effective measures to increase security posture, but also to take an objective and realistic view. The SEC statement reveals that an internal document from SolarWinds’ mentions that “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”  \n\nThis is not an uncommon predicament. Companies frequently find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to security issues and often fail to allocate enough funds and personnel to rectify them. Furthermore, ‘alert fatigue’ is a rapidly growing problem, where security tools generate so many alerts that assessing and fixing them becomes an impossible task.  \n\nThis is one of the key issues Cyscale set out to solve. Through the application of context to each security alert, Cyscale’s mission is to help companies overcome the challenges of slim resources and budgets by prioritizing security issues and guiding professionals to work on the 20% of things that matter and make 80% of the difference.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","seoTitle":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","description":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","seoDescription":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","date":"2023-10-24T11:26:33.738Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cyscale-europas-hottest-cybersecurity-startup","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/cyscale-europas-awards.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg","srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/41be8/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/c78f7/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/913d0/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/91660/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/888e2/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"We are super excited to reveal that Cyscale – the [platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily](https://cyscale.com/) – has made the longlist for The Europas Awards 2023.  \n\n[The Europas,](https://www.theeuropas.com/) founded by Tech Crunch’s Mike Butcher, has been Europe’s most prestigious startup awards program for the last 15 years and has been instrumental in identifying some of the world’s most ambitious and successful startups, including Spotify, Deliveroo, Wise, and Starling Bank among many others.  \n\nCyscale entered the awards along with 400 other European startups and has made the cut in the cybersecurity category against five other entrants.  \n\n“It’s great to see Cyscale acknowledged among the Europas nominees as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security,” said Cyscale CEO Ovidiu Cical.  \n\n“Over 400 startups entered these awards and all of them are building their game-changing applications in the cloud.

Network administrators in legacy systems invest significant effort into securing routers, adding firewalls and ensuring that all network devices function correctly. In the cloud, under the shared responsibility model, the customer does not deal with physical devices anymore, and security is shifted to identity and access control, known as [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), which focuses on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets.  \n\n## Why is IAM important? \n\nIf a user with high privileges is compromised in the cloud, a situation can escalate to critical levels quickly leaving vulnerable apps and data exposed; this is why IAM is the first and most important line of defense against attackers.  \n\n## How do you manage IAM in the cloud? \n\nNowadays, every employee has multiple accounts for different tools they use, such as HR applications, a CRM or ERP solution, various cloud platforms, and more. We do not live in a world where one person equals one account to manage, meaning the process of securing access is complicated from the start.  \n\nA single developer or other IT employee might need to have access to multiple cloud environments, a version control system, a deployment platform, and a ticket management system, and if you multiply that by 10 or 100 employees the number of accounts or users you need to manage is quickly getting into the hundreds or thousands.  \n\nIt’s impossible to manually handle so many accounts and ensure that they’re all properly secured, granted appropriate permissions, and correctly deprovisioned when employees leave.  \n\n### Key IAM processes: The access management lifecycle   \n\nLet’s take a look at the key stages in the access management lifecycle, keeping in mind that these processes need to apply to the individual and all the user accounts they are associated with: \n\n* **Onboarding:** the first stage involves creating a new user, assigning roles to it and providing permissions over resources. \n* **Role management:** in this stage, roles are already defined and configured for users. New roles and permissions may be added based on needs. \n* **Access review:** these are periodic evaluations of permissions assigned to users, groups, or roles. This stage involves reviewing and validating that individuals or entities have appropriate access levels based on their current roles and responsibilities. \n* **Offboarding:** This stage is crucial and involves removing users from the company's systems, revoking permissions and disabling accounts, thus preventing unauthorized access after an individual leaves the organization. \n\n### Centralizing IAM processes in the cloud \n\nIn order to handle an impossible workload and ensure due process is followed each and every time, centralization has become key. Let’s look at best practices to secure [IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) throughout the identity lifecycle. \n\n### SSO (Single Sign-On) \n\nOften, companies will deploy multiple cloud accounts, and the best practice is to organize these using provider specific mechanisms (ie. Organizations and Folders in AWS, Management Groups in Azure, etc.). Managing identities at cloud account level would quickly become unmanageable and it’s best to keep those at a minimum. \n\nA cloud company should use an identity provider (whether that’s one built-in into the cloud service provider, such as Azure AD, or an external SSO provider, like [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/)) to manage cloud access, as opposed to having multiple users defined within individual cloud accounts. \n\nManaging identities in a central location, as well as using SSO, are key elements of ensuring IAM security in the cloud. These are the risks of not using SSO in your company: \n\n1. **Password fatigue leading to security issues.** Having users input their passwords multiple times a day and for different applications can and probably will lead to them re-using the same password across multiple platforms or using very simple, easy to remember passwords. No-one wants to pull out the password manager 20 times a day. Password fatigue can lead to credentials leak and may put a company in danger.  \n2. **Long-term credentials accidentally disclosed or stolen.** Managing cloud access at individual account level implies creating long-term credentials such as passwords or access keys. Through SSO, temporary credentials are used and they expire after the user's session. This helps mitigate the risk of long-term credential exposure, because even if these temporary credentials were to be leaked, they would only be valid for a short period.\n3. **It’s overall a better user experience.**  \n\n### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) \n\nThis is considered essential. To clarify the point: your employees should not have any accounts without MFA. Whether they’re using a passwordless solution, or still using passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone, but especially for high-privilege users.  \n\nWe can’t labor this point enough. There are so many breaches that could have been prevented with MFA! For example, [Deloitte suffered an incident in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails) where the company’s clients were affected just because an administrative account did not have MFA. Emails, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and even health data were at risk. \n\nIn 2014, Home Depot had an estimated 56 million payment cards exposed after a third-party vendor’s stolen login details were used to breach the company. Again, MFA could have prevented such a breach. \n\nIf you’re already using SSO in your company, you should enforce an MFA policy at the identity provider level and better manage this setting for all your users. \n\nWe even demonstrated how MFA can prevent an attack from spreading in an Azure cloud environment, you can read that article [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/compromising-azure-cloud-as-guest/). \n\nBeware however that threat actors are innovating in this space too. A newish social engineering type approach known as an MFA Fatigue attack sees hackers relentlessly pushing MFA access requests to users’ endpoint devices and combining this with stolen logins to try and wear down a user to the point where they accidently allow access.  \n\n### Get full visibility of users and accounts \n\nYou can’t secure what you can’t see (or you don’t know about). So, it’s impossible to have a good security posture in the cloud without full visibility of all your assets, your people and their respective user accounts, role assignments, groups, and so on. \n\nThis is why a centralized solution for access review is the best approach to managing this challenge: having all permissions, roles, and user accounts visible via one single dashboard is very attractive for security professionals trying to manage access in the cloud. \n\nIn the image below we notice how one single person has permissions over Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, GitHub, and other environments. Besides this, we see the effective permissions assigned to each cloud account or application, security information such as the password’s lifetime and whether MFA is activated; this information would normally be spread out across multiple consoles and hard to follow. \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" title=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUsing this dashboard, you can review users’ access in a timely manner, without missing important information. You can go through users one by one and review the permissions they have, instead of circling through groups and permissions trying to figure out what users inherit based on their group assignment. \n\nAfter configuring your cloud environment and assigning roles and permissions, an IAM dashboard like the one in the image above can help you to identify any gaps left in your cloud user management and should be treated as best practice.  \n\n### Finding and resolving excessive permissions \n\nIdentifying users with excessive permissions can help prevent an attacker from escalating privileges in a cloud environment. You can use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) to assign high privileges for a limited amount of time to users and therefore limit the attack surface.  \n\nFollow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) when configuring users’ roles and permissions to ensure that they do not have access to resources they don’t need to use. \n\nIn the previous section, we looked at an IAM dashboard and identified how many user accounts a single person has. On the right-hand side of the dashboard, we can see a “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" title=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe user ‘John’ has a Contributor role over the second subscription in Azure, revealing a wide range of permissions. This user has full access to manage all resources, meaning he can modify and delete resources. Alarm bells should start ringing here because if this user were to be compromised, the entire Azure environment would be at risk.\n\n### Best practices for identity and access control  \n\nEffective IAM is crucial in today's cloud security landscape.

Romania, for example, has earned its title as the ‘Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe’ thanks to the strength of the tech community in Cluj-Napoca, the second largest city in the country.  \n\n## **Public cloud as an enabler and a challenge** \n\nThe public cloud is the key enabler for all these businesses. But while cloud services from AWS, Azure, Google, Alibaba and others are more widely adopted and more secure than ever before, the cloud is an increasingly complex technology to manage, with a multitude of proprietary settings and controls, growing ever more granular. As a result, the greatest challenge to cloud as an enabler exists not in the security of the cloud itself, but in the policies, controls, and workflows for security of the technology.  \n\n## **Cloud security breaches are caused by mistakes and misconfigurations**  \n\nIn nearly all cases of cloud data breach, it is the user, not the cloud provider, who fails to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. In fact, Gartner estimates 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault and there is a wealth of additional research to back this up. \n\nThe simple fact is that humans can no longer correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually because of the sheer volume of alerts and complexity of configurations. The problem of SaaS security is especially pervasive in companies with small security teams, where it’s also especially hard for a CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure to prioritize remediation.   \n\nNot even large, well-resourced companies are exempt, with Microsoft, Twitter, and T-Mobile among the headlines in 2023 for security incidents leading to significant breaches of cloud data.   \n\n## **What makes an effective cloud security strategy?** \n\nIf you’re a SaaS CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure responsible for apps and data at a cloud-native or cloud-first business you need to deploy an effective cloud security strategy from the get-go. We’ve put together this SaaS CTO security checklist to help you understand what you need to do to get cloud security measures right from the start.\n\n## **The SaaS CTO security checklist**\n\nIn this article we look at the *[five key pillars that make up a strong cloud security strategy,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/)* including how to understand your unique cloud environment based on your specific usage of AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or whichever provider you choose.  \n\nYou also need to consider that your cloud environment may not be static, with developers adding and removing assets, and sensitive data being created on a frequent basis. So, this means your cloud security approach can’t be static either, and you will need some kind of continuous monitoring and assessment program to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities along with a regular review of security policies.  \n\nIn this *[guide to cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)* we go into actionable detail that will help you create a roadmap for deployment of your cloud security strategy, covering data security when data is in motion, in use, and at rest, the types of attacks that threaten your data and what you can do to defend against them.  \n\n## **Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure** \n\nA foundational building block for any cloud-native cybersecurity strategy is a thorough understanding of your infrastructure and unique characteristics of your web applications including microservices architectures, virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing, among others. \n\nThis guide looks at how you can *[properly assess your cloud-native infrastructure,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-infrastructure/)* draw conclusions and create an efficient plan for remediation.  \n\nIf you need a *[deeper dive into the cloud-native technology stack,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/)* our explainer looks at the differences between cloud-native, cloud-based, and cloud-enabled approaches.  \n\n## **Understanding CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** \n\nAs adoption of the cloud has grown, so too has the need for specialized tools to secure it. At some point you will have come across the term Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) as an essential part of a cloud security program designed to identify and expose the unintentional risks that can expose your data, or make your code or your infrastructure vulnerable to hackers. \n\n## **What is CSPM?** \n\nCSPM solutions use the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google, to gather rich data on your specific cloud configuration and workloads. These cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\nUnintentional cloud configuration mistakes typically occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility into the organization’s cloud security posture due to too many dashboards, management panels, or controls. This becomes your problem.  \n\nRegardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to a disastrous data breach or leakage. \n\nWe have an *[essential guide to understanding Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/)* for those that need familiarize themselves.   \n\n## **Best practices for CSPM** \n\nIn our *[CSPM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/)* document, we look at how CSPM solutions can be used to ensure visibility of assets; use context to identify and prioritize assets with the greatest risk; ensure compliance with relevant frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST and more); maintain ongoing monitoring of your environment to identify new threats; and finally, direct you to efficient remediation.    \n\n## **What to look for in a CSPM solution** \n\nOur separate guide on *[what to look for in a CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/)* equips you with key questions to ask and considerations to help you make the right choice for your business at your current state of cloud maturity.  \n\nWhile our *[buyer’s guide to cloud security solutions](https://cyscale.com/blog/buyers-guide-cloud-security-solutions/)* goes into even further detail regarding the difference between enterprise-grade solutions, security offerings from your cloud service provider, and the free tools on offer.  \n\n## **Understanding CNAPP** \n\nAnother acronym you may encounter - CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) - refers to a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps and combines multiple functionalities from separate toolsets, including CSPM, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), essentially covering all the bases of identity and access, code, and infrastructure.  \n\nWe have a primer on *[cloud-native applications security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/)* that looks at why and when you may need a CNAPP solution.  \n\n## **Common cloud misconfigurations and how to avoid them** \n\nIn terms of actionable insights, our extensive handbook on *[common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/)* looks at five of the most common cloud misconfigurations SaaS companies encounter, including: storage access configuration, access control, unrestricted network ports for inbound and outbound traffic, encryption oversights, or disabled or misconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\nWorking through this checklist can help you establish best practices for securing your apps and data in the cloud, including the use of tags to help establish security policies across all your relevant assets.  \n\n## **The dangers of alert fatigue** \n\nBy the time you have designed a cloud security strategy and possibly deployed a few tools to help you enforce it, you will begin generating security alerts.  \n\nFalse positive alerts are the bane of any CTO or CISO and with cloud environments becoming so complex, alert fatigue is a very real and growing problem. A constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming, because when everything is important, nothing is important.  \n\n*[Alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/)* is one of the biggest complaints cybersecurity professionals have about the tools they use. As a Cloud Security Manager we spoke to says: \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\"  \n\nSo when it comes to beating alert fatigue, the onus is on the tools you use, and we believe three innovations are essential: \n\nCustom risk rules – Define your own threshold for security posture. What works for one company won’t work for another. \n\nAutomation – With so many assets across so many cloud providers to track, humans cannot keep up. Continuous and automated detection of misconfigurations is critical. \n\nContext - Not all alerts are created equal, and different teams have different responsibilities. Context allows you to immediately prioritize tasks. \n\nWhich brings us to... \n\n## **Incident response planning** \n\nThis is a critical part of any effective cloud security plan, because while an effective security strategy focuses on preventative maintenance, an incident response plan sets out the steps you take when a security breach happens.  \n\n## **Designing an effective incident response plan** \n\nWe have a *[step-by-step checklist in our essential cloud security tips](https://cyscale.com/blog/essential-tips-cloud-security/)* you can use to establish your incident response plan, looking at: \n\n* Determining what caused the incident \n* Containing the incident \n* Notifying affected parties such as customers if customer data is affected\n* Conducting a root cause analysis \n* Implementing remediation measures \n* Learnings and evaluation \n\nAs the threat landscape constantly evolves, so must your cloud security awareness and strategy. Business leaders must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities as well as any changes in their existing environment.  \n\nEven with a good cloud security strategy in place, an effective plan is an adaptive plan, and one that ensures ongoing defense against new threats.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["IAM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","description":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the first line of defense against attackers in the cloud.

It may not seem like much if a user has read permissions over a storage account, but if that storage account contains sensitive data, such as credentials for another account, then the magnitude of the impact will surpass your initial assessment. \n\nIn this article, I will show you how human mistakes can lead to a complex attack path, where a malicious user gains access to a storage account, compromises a user, and ultimately gains access to a key vault that contains cryptographic keys and secrets used by the company’s apps. \n\nI’ve chosen a scenario where gross mistakes are made to highlight that you should not underestimate human error and the blast radius it can have.  \n\n## Case Study\n\nFintech Inc. is a financial technology startup developing a new banking application. A few customers already use the new app to access their banking data in real-time and manage their accounts. Fintech Inc. uses Microsoft Azure to develop and host their app. \n\nThe company must invite an external consultant, Anita, to collaborate in the cloud. Any user is allowed by default to invite guests in Microsoft Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory), so John, a member of the IT department, invites Anita as a guest. \n\nHowever, he makes a mistake; because he’s trying to accomplish many things in a short period of time, instead of inviting anita@fintechinc.com, he invites anita@fintech.com. The new guest user accepts the invitation and becomes a guest in Microsoft Entra ID. \n\nAs a guest, the \"fake\" Anita cannot do much. She can only access some resources that guests can access, she can manage her profile and collaborate with other users in Office 365 apps.  \n\nBut, looking closely, she discovers that she is now part of the ITAdmins group. How did that happen?! On a closer look, ITAdmins has a dynamic membership rule that states that all users whose department is \"IT\" become part of the group. The IT department wanted to make things easy for them and allow all employees in IT to join this group automatically. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-dynamic-membership-rule.png\" alt=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" title=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, this rule is very broad and opens up the possibility for mistakes. In this case, Anita was assigned the “IT” department, and she immediately joined the ITAdmins group, since Azure checks the attributes for a user whenever they are changed or a new user joins the cloud.  \n\nUpon further investigation, Anita discovers that the ITAdmins group has a very highly privileged role over the “rg-management\" resource group – the Contributor role. This role allows Anita to view, modify, and delete any resources within the resource group. Here comes the importance of the Least Privilege Principle – granting users too many permissions can do more harm than good. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-it-admins-contributor-rg-management.png\" alt=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" title=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we take a look at this resource group, we will see it contains an interesting storage account – “backups”, a database, and a VM. \n\nWe can see this relation in the graph below. Tracing the attack path, we immediately realize how Anita is able to access the cloud assets, from the rg-management resource group through the new role she gained by joining ITAdmins, and therefore compromise them. By looking at context in the cloud, we become aware of the risk imposed by the ITAdmins groups, which has broad permissions over a multitude of important resources. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-first-graph.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the attack path\" title=\"Graph showing the attack path\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe storage account has a \"backups\" container with a \"diskBackup.vhd\" file inside. This contains the files and data an ex-employee used before leaving the company. While in a rush, an IT admin has decided to back up the disk and look at it at some other time, later forgetting about it. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-backups-container.png\" alt=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" title=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUpon restoring this file as a computer disk, Anita discovers a set of credentials. She knows she should not log in using those credentials, but she does it anyway – after all, this is not the first questionable action she’s done -, because she is curious.  \n\nThe set of credentials – an email and a password – are for a test user that was created in the past to test features of the application, the removal of which was forgotten. The user cannot log in to the portal due to a Conditional Access policy that denies access to the Microsoft Azure Management resource (Portal included).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-access-to-portal-denied.png\" alt=\"Portal access denied for user\" title=\"Portal access denied for user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nFortunately, Anita can still log in using the credentials – through the CLI. This is a common \"bypass\" of this barrier, and, fortunately, she's good with command lines, so she can investigate what permissions her new user has. \n\nShe checks her new role assignments in the current subscription using the commandlet *Get-AzRoleAssignment* only to find, among other roles, that she’s a Key Vault Administrator. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-key-vault-administrator-role.png\" alt=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" title=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the Key Vault Administrator role, Anita can [perform all data plane operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) on the Credentials2 key vault that we can see in the image above, and all objects in it. \n\nA key vault is a huge discovery for Anita, who can investigate further. Using the commandlet *Get-AzKeyVaultSecret*, Anita can see that there are a few keys and secrets in the key vault. She can now read them, delete them or add new versions of those secrets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-contents-of-the-key-vault.png\" alt=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" title=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-second-graph.png\" alt=\"The attack path for the new user\" title=\"The attack path for the new user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nAnita can now further discover other assets available on Fintech Inc.’s Azure cloud environment and possibly make use of the secrets stored in the “Credentials2” Key Vault. For example, we know that, as a best practice, [databases are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/), so a leaked decryption cryptographic key, for example, can lead to total compromise of the company’s data. \n\nTo understand everything that happened here, we need to look at all the bad practices and vulnerabilities that we have uncovered, in chronological order: \n\n1. Due to being in a rush, an employee invited the wrong person to collaborate in Azure, and no one picked up on it. \n2. The dynamic membership rule for the ITAdmins group is very broad and may accept unintended cases. \n3. The ITAdmins group has a highly privileged role over a resource group with many resources that may contain sensitive information, such as databases, and storage accounts. \n4. A disk backup that can be restored is held unencrypted in a storage account, containing a cleartext password for an active Azure account. \n5. A test user that was intended to be temporary is still active. \n6. A test user has access to a very high-value resource. \n\nAs you can see, each mistake allowed the intruder to advance more and more and compromise additional resources. \n\nThis is why contextual security and proper IAM security are necessary. Contextual security allows cloud professionals to understand what assets are impacted by others, while IAM best practices protect the cloud environment from intruders and represent the first barrier of entry.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":9,"currentPage":1,"category":"All","seoTitle":"Blog - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Cloud and Data Security Blog","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","IAM","CNAPP","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
