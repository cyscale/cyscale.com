But while these developments have made it easier than ever to deploy applications, they have dramatically changed the landscape in terms of security.   \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture to traditional non-native applications, it is essential to understand how the key features of cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns and are driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) as a result.  \n\n## How is cloud-native infrastructure different?  \n\nCloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes. Cloud-native applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). \n\nThese technologies significantly increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but they introduce new concerns in terms of security along with a much larger attack surface area.   \n\n## What is a CNAPP? \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP is becoming a necessary solution to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.   \n\nCoined by Gartner, [cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are described as a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.  \n\nOne of the key features being that CNAPPs consolidate several previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), runtime cloud workload protection and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning, into one solution. \n\nThis guide will help you understand the most important features of a CNAPP that secure cloud-native applications and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:   \n\n* [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) (Cloud Security Posture Management)   \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)  \n* [CIEM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iam-security/) (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management)  \n* [KSPM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/kubernetes-security-platform/) (Kubernetes Security Posture Management)  \n* Container Security \n\n**G﻿et an overview of CNAPP capabilities**\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/Cyscale-explainer-video-2023-12-Dec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n## Visibility of cloud-native infrastructure \n\nWhereas traditional environments relied largely on proprietary software, isolated hardware, and almost total control of the stack, cloud-native environments may stretch across multiple clouds, make use of open-source code, require identity-based segmentation, and feature ephemeral workloads.   \n\nAs a result, context-aware visibility of all these assets and resources is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Not only is the surface area for attack dramatically increased, you also need to determine whether a vulnerability in one resource is innocuous or if it creates a toxic combination through its relationship with other assets.   \n\nA misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access and serve as a jumping-off point to more resources, for example.   \n\nTherefore, the visibility features found in CSPM solutions are incorporated into CNAPP to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. Usually, visibility comes in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can illustrate current security scores, assets that need your attention, and other elements that may help you understand your cloud. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see all your cloud resources in one place, so as to be constantly aware of your cloud environment? \n* Does it provide full coverage and visibility into your cloud estate and risks, including cloud configuration, workload, and identity? \n* Does it bring your multi-cloud infrastructure together in one tool and deliver risk-aware context? \n* Does it identify assets that might or have drifted from your organization’s compliance baseline? \n\n## Cloud-native security controls  \n\nManually going through every cloud asset configuration to check for issues and vulnerabilities is tedious and error prone in smaller estates and impossible in large cloud environments where thousands of assets are in use. Don’t forget that the approach for AWS is different to that of Azure, is different to Google Cloud, and different again with Kubernetes.   \n\nA certified expert in one environment does not equal transferable skills to another.  \n\nTo solve these challenges, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and either automate the remediation of or provide guidance to address issues. The application of automation, using Machine Learning and AI, not only saves considerable time but reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP provide contextual triaging and prioritization or send targeted alerts for high-priority assets to reduce and relieve alert fatigue? \n* Does it detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, enabling you to react and fix findings quickly, saving your organization from a breach? \n* Does it deliver efficient remediation steps on detected issues? \n\n## Data security in the cloud \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications with ephemeral workloads and infrastructure that is scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be unwittingly exposed. Through DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, CNAPPs can help keep track of data stores and provide actionable suggestions for your organization to secure your crown jewels. \n\nA CNAPP will detect and highlight unencrypted storage resources, cryptographic keys with insecure configurations or upcoming expirations, assets that are publicly accessible, and other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may leave your organization’s sensitive data exposed.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Are the Data Security Dashboard capabilities of the CNAPP capable of pinpointing blind spots in your infrastructure? \n* Some cloud providers encrypt data in storage resources by default, while others do not so it is easy to overlook what you think you know and miss important details. Does the CNAPP help you understand your encryption status? \n* Instead of dealing with cryptographic key rotation and deletion, some CNAPPs show you what keys need to be rotated and when. Does the CNAPP provide this capability? \n\n## Container image scanning   \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.   \n\nRetroactively, a CNAPP can identify which container images have vulnerabilities and where those images are running in your infrastructure. \n\nFor example, if a container image uses an unpatched version of Log4J, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications in that container.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP check container images for vulnerabilities to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your infrastructure? \n* Does the CNAPP help you understand who has permissions over containers to prevent unauthorized access? \n* Are you able to monitor for and identify any misconfigurations developers might have missed when spinning up containers? \n\n## Cloud workloads protection  \n\nThe Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) component of a CNAPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in CVEs and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them.  \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes:  \n\n* VMs \n* Containers  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see running workloads in one dashboard to easily keep you up to date with your organization’s activity all the time? \n* Does it help you prioritize vulnerable workloads efficiently based on severity to ensure effective remediation measures? \n* Does it automatically keep up with emerging threats, so you don’t have to check the news all the time? Your CNAPP should do the work for you by constantly checking your workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\n## Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior.  \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are:  \n\n* Unauthorized access   \n* Missing patches   \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP give you visibility of your Kubernetes objects? \n* Does it help you assess your cluster based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark, which contains up-to-date and industry-standard best practices? \n* Does it detect vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster with no need for manual effort from your team? You should be able to see where you have Kubernetes images with vulnerabilities and where those images are deployed.  \n\n## CIEM and IAM: Access management   \n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is an essential component of cloud-native applications security specific to the CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) part of the platform. With complex cloud environments, keeping track of users and services, their different access levels, and what impact certain permissions have can become challenging.  \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to, but not limited to, the following aspects:  \n\n* Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making them more difficult to manage  \n* Cloud-native software may run across multi-cloud environments as well as on-premises  \n* The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing identities at the service level \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to better secure their cloud in terms of identity and access management.   \n\n## Best practices regarding IAM:  \n\n* Implement multi-factor authentication for all users. This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification  \n* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity  \n* Comply with the Least Privilege Principle to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary for the user to do their job  \n* Assign permissions at group level and assign well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP identify any drifts from your company’s security or compliance posture using a powerful IAM dashboard that pinpoints users with issues, such as the ones that do not have MFA enabled? \n* Does the CNAPP give you an understanding of your password policies and identify if users have old passwords? \n* Does it help you understand if users or groups have more permissions than necessary? \n* Does the CNAPP support you in performing effective access reviews that don’t take all day and require no manual work? \n* Does it help you gain confidence in your organization’s security posture? \n\n## Compliance  \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their compliance journey. The CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet the requirements of various compliance frameworks.   \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to perform assessments in preparation for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards a CNAPP should provide support for are are:  \n\n* ISO 27001   \n* SOC 2  \n* GDPR  \n* PCI-DSS  \n* HIPAA  \n* NIST \n\nOther standards like DORA are becoming increasingly important for some sectors, and there are regional equivalents of some regulations like Brazil’s LGDP data protection laws. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP help you track your compliance progress in real-time and ensure you are able to understand how your organization is doing in terms of compliance posture? \n* Does the CNAPP keep a track record of your efforts that can be presented during an audit? \n* Are all of your organization's cloud resources tracked in one place, so you know that the compliance assessment is comprehensive and accurate and you're not missing anything? \n* Can you view your compliance score at-a-glance and at any time? \n* Are you able to export detailed reports to help explain your security and compliance posture to other stakeholders or to help you make a case to the board? \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/full-platform-tour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">TAKE A TOUR OF CYSCALE'S CNAPP</button></a></div>\n\n## Summary: CNAPP as a critical part of cloud-native security \n\nAs cloud-native application development has penetrated the market, it has not only expanded the infrastructure estate but also the number of teams involved, from devops, to platform engineers, cloud architects, security experts, compliance practitioners, and more.  \n\nLikewise, security solutions have evolved in tandem, moving beyond the more static nature of the CSPM, to the more dynamic capabilities of a CNAPP, with an integrated, lifecycle security and compliance approach to protecting workloads and applications. \n\nThe vendor landscape is competitive and vendor portfolios have either grown through acquisition or original development. The result is that many established vendor CNAPP offerings are bolted together point solutions with little or no integration.  \n\nCloud-native organizations going down this route will need to ensure they have the resources available to learn and operate several different tools and even take on some of the work around correlation and context in cloud security.  \n\nThe main concern with challenger or incoming CNAPP vendors, on the other hand, might be a lack of maturity in the components, even though the platform itself is designed with integration in mind.  \n\nOrganizations will need to carefully assess the capabilities of the CNAPP solution to ensure it meets their specific needs, without requiring too many resources or investments, and with room for future growth.  \n\nThat said, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are regarded as a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, its high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient.  \n\n### C﻿hoosing a CNAPP\n\n**Overall, CNAPP solutions offer:**  \n\n1.

But this year it’s different. \n\nThe rapid and unpredictable rise of AI has drawn attention through all of 2023, leading to questions about the positive and negative impact it will have on lives and businesses going forward.  \n\nThere’s no doubt AI-driven attacks will be a pivotal challenge that defines the cloud security landscape for 2024, but it’s not the only consideration characterized by intricate and cutting-edge vulnerabilities and attacks. \n\nLet's take a close look at the top 10 cloud security challenges we've identified in the last year that need to be closely monitored in 2024 and beyond. \n\n# 1. Advanced AI-driven threats \n\nThroughout 2023, AI exploded as a megatrend that changes the risk landscape significantly – both positively and negatively. We’ve seen AI-powered DDoS attacks, where attackers use automation to adjust threat vectors based on real-time analysis of success against various attack surfaces, and ransomware and malware that can adapt to the environment and replicate using existing and newly discovered vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe potential for generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is a double-edged sword, and the cloud security landscape feels uncertain as attackers come up with more and more sophisticated attacks. \n\nIn 2023, hackers managed to abuse the growing popularity of OpenAI's well-known tool, ChatGPT. [The chatbot was found to be \"hallucinating\"](https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk) in its responses to questions about coding packages and libraries and recommending things that didn't exist.  \n\nHackers went ahead and created malicious packages with the same names, so developers receiving the same recommendations from ChatGPT would download the malicious software. \n\nAlthough the threat is of great concern, it’s not all doom and gloom, according to Google Cloud’s own CISO. While it’s true we expect to see AI help attackers, AI should also give defenders a [significant advantage because AI is good at amplifying capability based on data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-how-the-ai-megatrend-can-help-manage-threats-reduce-toil-and-scale-talent) — and defenders have more data. \n\n## Protecting against AI-driven threats \n\nIn this rapidly changing field, continuous education regarding emerging AI-threats is vital. Awareness campaigns and training are the best weapons against these kinds of attacks. \n\nCloud security solutions such as [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) are also leading the application of AI to make cybersecurity more human friendly. As security practitioners are overwhelmed by information, making sense of that information in terms of context and inference is becoming more of a challenge.  \n\n Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant is a move towards making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\nOur platform can [automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues](https://cyscale.com/blog/introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant/) using the specific customers’ cloud footprint combined with LLMs of vulnerabilities and exploits.     \n\n# 2. Phishing and Social Engineering \n\nHuman behavior remains one of the staples in any list of risks, both as an external threat as well as an internal one due to disgruntled employees.  \n\nAs an external threat, phishing is still one of the most effective attacks. Humans are always the weak link in the security chain, and AI is making defending from social engineering attacks even harder due to the ease with which deep fakes can be produced that appear to be someone you know, to automated, convincing emails, messages, and chats with no grammar errors or that take on the tone and style of a specific person. \n\nIn the cloud, [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) (Identity and Access Management) is the first line of defense when focusing on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets. \n\nLeaked credentials and bypassed authentication processes are very dangerous and can lead to massive disasters, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. \n\n## Protecting against phishing and social engineering attacks \n\nTraining programs for social engineering attacks are necessary to prevent employees from falling for phishing scams.  \n\nEnforcing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is essential. Whether you’re using a passwordless solution or passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone and especially for high-privilege users.   \n\n# 3. Evolving regulatory frameworks \n\nAs technology advances, we see more and more updates and additions to [compliance laws and standards](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/) ensuring both businesses and customer data are adequately protected.  \n\nMaintaining compliance with the increasing complexity of frameworks and benchmarks can become overwhelming very quickly, especially for small teams.  \n\nFor example, in 2023, we saw multiple [updates to CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) for cloud services including Azure, AWS, and Kubernetes.  \n\nFor financial institutions, the implementation deadline for [DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) is also quickly approaching, with the release scheduled for early 2025 (17th of January). \n\nAll told, 2024 is a pivotal year for compliance and companies must keep up with the evolving regulations and maintain a good cloud security posture to protect themselves from emerging cybersecurity threats. \n\n## Maintaining compliance with cloud security regulations and standards \n\nBecause of the ever-changing landscape, staying on top of cloud security compliance is a continuous process that involves regular assessments of your cloud estate and compliance posture.  \n\nYou can keep up to date on new and changing requirements by [reading our blog posts.](https://cyscale.com/blog/compliance/) Furthermore, cloud security solutions like [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) can also help you keep track of your compliance progress and know where you’re standing. \n\n# 4. Quantum computing for password cracking \n\nWidely used encryption algorithms such as RSA were originally designed to withstand traditional computing attack methods, requiring a significant amount of computations to be made in order to crack passwords.  \n\nThe entire cryptographic landscape is currently based on this solution, with RSA protecting sensitive data everywhere. But developments in quantum computing keep advancing and threaten to make the impossible number of computations achievable.  \n\nAs a result, it’s expected that traditional encryption methods might one day become obsolete. The day quantum computing attacks will become possible is named Q-day, and it might be around the corner. \n\n## Protecting against quantum computing attacks \n\nIn parallel with developments in quantum computing, [quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms) or post-quantum cryptography are our only solutions at this time, and the first group of encryption tools that are designed to withstand the assault of a future quantum computer are in development.   \n\n# 5. Complexity in multi-cloud environments \n\nIt’s often said that the real killer in cloud security is the complexity. Cloud platforms and products have evolved in a granular fashion and security has followed suit. One often quoted Gartner prediction is that 99% of cloud security failures through 2025 will be due to user error as admins struggle to keep control of sprawling estates.\n\nCloud service providers offer menus of products and services running into the hundreds, each with their own security configuration, and in a multi-cloud environment this complexity is amplified.  \n\nManaging data security in multi-cloud environments can be especially challenging due to cloud providers' different configurations, security policies, even their vocabulary. As new tools appear, fully understanding a multi-cloud infrastructure can become harder. Remember, a certified AWS cloud expert is not an Azure cloud expert by default, and vice versa.   \n\n## Reducing complexity in multi-cloud environments\n\nBringing all your cloud assets, information, and configurations into one single platform is the key to not getting lost in your own cloud, and this means adopting a security strategy that includes a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) or a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) solution.   \n\nGartner research found that CSPM implementations can reduce cloud security incidents caused by misconfigurations by up to 80%. The single-pane-of-glass view across your multi-cloud estate also cuts down on the need to switch between multiple dashboards and means you can understand your entire cloud inventory in context.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/inventory-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 6. Cybersecurity alert fatigue \n\nStress and burnout are rampant among cybersecurity professionals and the impact of [user fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/) is no secret - thousands of alerts and logs that signal everything and anything that happens in the cloud is not a helpful approach. In many cloud security setups, the default process is to alert for every event, regardless of its criticality.  \n\nThis flood of alerts can quickly become overwhelming for cloud security professionals who become used to severe or critical alerts popping up every day. When everything is critical, nothing is. So, this can desensitize them, and when an actual breach occurs and legitimately critical alerts are sent out, they can end up being overlooked. \n\nThis approach can also turn into a resource hog, giving security practitioners an endless list of tasks to work through that might not achieve the desired results.  \n\n## Protecting against alert fatigue \n\nTo prevent user fatigue, contextual security is the best approach and your ability to prioritize remediation work efficiently depends on the capabilities of your [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) or [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nBy filtering out alerts that are not actually high risk in your unique cloud environment and shifting focus to your own most sensitive cloud resources, you can help your security people work more effectively.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/alerts-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 7. Executive decisions and responsibilities \n\nOne of the biggest challenges a CISO or CTO faces when approaching the board or C suite for funding is justifying their cybersecurity spend. There has long been a perception gap between the cost of security versus the cost of a breach and the simple truth is, you can spend some money up front to reduce the likelihood of a breach, or you can spend more later when the breach has happened.  \n\nThe [global average cost of a data breach has climbed 15% over the last three years](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs) and with lagging investment, only about one third of breaches are picked up by an organization’s own team.  \n\nFurthermore, we’ve seen how decisions made by individuals in executive positions make or break a company through their impact on the company's security strategy. Look at the [SolarWinds case](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/) as an example, where the SolarWinds CISO ended up being investigated for fraud over failure to fully disclose security gaps and issues in the company. \n\nThere’s also the issue of how those responsible for executing on the security strategy are impacted by executive decisions. The SEC investigation into SolarWinds found that “the volume of security issues being identified have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”   \n\n## Empowering security leaders to be effective \n\nAs increasing board liability for risk is sinking in, CTOs, CISOs, and security leaders should be looking to justify their security spend by aligning it with business goals, and instead of operating in a vacuum to build a culture of cybersecurity.  \n\nThis also means formulating policies and establishing processes (and actually following them!) is an approach that all companies need to be doing to ensure employees follow good practices and don't move away from established rules. \n\n# 8. Insider threats and privilege misuse \n\nSometimes, it's easy to focus on preventing unwanted access from external actors and forgetting that harm can also be done from the inside. Malicious or unintentional actions by employees with privileged access can pose significant security risks. \n\nEstimates vary but most research agrees that more than half of security breaches experienced are a result of internal threats or abuse of privilege. \n\n## Protecting against insider threats \n\nTo prevent against damage caused by current or previous employees, ensure that: \n\n* When offboarding users, you're removing all access and not leaving any dangling permissions that can be abused, \n* You're following the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only assigning the necessary permissions for the amount of time required, \n* You're monitoring user activity and performing regular assessments of user access and permissions. \n\n# 9. Cryptographic keys management \n\nManaging encryption keys effectively is critical for safeguarding data. With the growing volume of encrypted data in the cloud, ensuring secure storage, access, rotation, and revocation of encryption keys has become challenging. \n\nWhy is the way you store and manage cryptographic keys so important? A good example is the leak of 38TB of secrets that occurred in 2023, when a GitHub repository owned by Microsoft’s AI research division provided a link to a misconfigured Azure storage resource. \n\n[Microsoft AI Researchers exposed](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-ai-accidently-leaked-38tb/) crypto keys, passwords, and other data through a storage account that could be accessed using leaked SAS (Shared Access Signature) tokens. If encryption keys are leaked, the effort of encrypting data goes to waste. \n\nAnd it’s not just about protecting data but maintaining access to it. If an encryption key expires before it’s rotated out, you could end up losing access to precious data.  \n\n## Effective cryptographic keys management \n\nAs part of an effective CSPM approach, you need a solid crypto key management strategy. Cloud security platforms like Cyscale check a wide palette of settings using security controls across multiple cloud service providers to ensure keys on different platforms remain secure. \n\nA few examples are: \n\n* Ensure encryption keys are not expiring within the next 14 days \n* Ensure encryption keys don't have permissive access policies \n* Ensure in-use encryption keys are not scheduled for deletion \n* Ensure Cloud KMS cryptokeys are not anonymously or publicly accessible \n\n  <video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 10. Incident Response \n\nPreventative cybersecurity measures will only take you so far. Developing and implementing robust incident response plans specific to cloud environments is essential.  \n\nAccording to the [annual M-Trends report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/m-trends-2023) by Mandiant, part of Google, global median dwell time was down to 16 days in 2023 from 21 the year before, meaning attacks are being detected more quickly than ever before.  \n\nAlthough this decrease is in part down to better tools and better approaches by defenders, an explosion in ransomware is also driving this number down as the point of these attacks is to make themselves known for extortion purposes.  \n\nSo, when it comes to responding to an active incident, speed is of the essence.  \n\n## Effective incident response in cloud security \n\nGiven the volume of tasks and pressure on human resources, automation can take a lot of the toil out of triage, prioritization, and remediation when it comes to detecting and acting on incidents.  \n\nEffective coordination, timely response to security incidents, and comprehensive recovery strategies are vital for minimizing damage and restoring operations. \n\nFinally, while resumption of normal operations is the priority, care should also be taken to preserve evidence during the recovery and remediation phases. In some cases this may even be a regulatory requirement.  \n\n## Challenges and opportunities in 2024: Adapting amid technological shifts   \n\nThe challenges of 2024 bring forward a landscape where technological advancements intertwine with vulnerabilities, creating a need for adaptable and comprehensive security strategies.  \n\nAs we navigate AI-driven threats, the looming potential of quantum computing, and growing multi-cloud environments, hackers find ever-more innovative ways to attack companies, and so we must focus on fortifying our defenses, meaning proactive measures become imperative. \n\nTo prepare for this changing landscape, book a free cloud security health assessment with Cyscale. Get complete visibility of your entire cloud estate in minutes and assess your cloud security posture, so you can expose, understand, and prioritize any threats. \n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image'/>\n</a>\n\n## Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment.

This means you can retrieve and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket, preventing deletion or overwriting of that object. \n\nIn a business that often creates new buckets, or updates objects in storage frequently, Cyscale’s custom controls would [check that the buckets are correctly configured](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). Without this check an organization could easily lose sensitive or important data. This is clearly something a significant portion of our customer base is concerned with. \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Reduce cloud security assessments from weeks to minutes \n\nSpeed is of the essence too. Although we were unable to draw averages from our customer base due to their wildly different internal processes, we were able to establish that broadly speaking, it can take a company up to two weeks to do the necessary data gathering and analysis to identify and assess misconfigurations on cloud resources like buckets. \n\nThis is before a manual prioritization of issues, considered against the company's specific operational and compliance requirements. \n\nWhat we could establish universally however, is that a customer using Cyscale was able to onboard their cloud environments (such as AWS) and perform their first scan to identify any misconfigured S3 buckets within 15 minutes.  \n\nThe [prioritization of identified issues happens in real-time](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) based on custom controls, eg. an S3 bucket discovered without versioning enabled would be flagged as a high-priority alert immediately. \n\nThis reduces a highly manual process taking two weeks, down to a highly automated 15 minutes.  \n\n## Cloud risk reduction of up to 70% \n\nOverall, we were able to reduce our customers’ cloud risk by an average of 16%. While this may not sound a lot, it takes into account many frequently changing cloud estates, where Cyscale is constantly surfacing new issues. We must also consider the rapid development of the Cyscale platform itself, which surfaces new issues as capabilities are deployed.  \n\nOne customer did in fact see a 70% reduction in risk, which speaks to our mission of being able to point you towards the top 20-30% of issues that will significantly reduce your risk.  \n\nThis finding is also a nod to the time saved by instantly seeing where vulnerable images and code are running within your infrastructure and making those findings prominent, reducing alert fatigue. \n\nEvery customer’s cloud infrastructure is unique, so it’s hard to draw common benefits, but since [we introduced the Scopes feature](https://cyscale.com/blog/major-update-cyscale/) earlier this year, many customers have reported architecture improvements carried out by leveraging asset graphs after segmenting their workloads into useful groups with Scopes.  \n\n## Tuesday is the day for security tasks  \n\nFinally, what would a year in review be without an interesting fact? While we were looking at our data set, one day of the week stood out as the most popular day for getting cloud security tasks ticked off, and that was Tuesday.  \n\nWhat is it about Tuesdays that make them the preferred day for productivity? We can’t say for sure, but we do know one customer topped the productivity leaderboard one particular Tuesday, by breezing through over 4,800 remediations.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Find unused cloud resources and save money \n\nThat’s not all though. If we dive into the data, there’s more to add to the big picture from small victories achieved by our customers that cannot be measured as easily. \n\nPeriodic IAM (Identity and Access Management) reviews can be accelerated and, in some cases, mostly automated, as Cyscale identifies excessive permissions, left-over users that need offboarding, and optimizes user management by revealing overprivileged accounts or entitlements that are not in use.  \n\nAnd there is also a great opportunity for cloud security solutions like Cyscale to help reduce your cloud infrastructure costs by identifying left-over and unused resources, as well as shadow infrastructure that has crept into your estate without your knowledge.\n\n<a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><img src=\"/img/wrapped-email.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"The MSSP Opportunity: Capturing Demand for Cloud Security","seoTitle":"The MSSP Opportunity: Capturing Demand for Cloud Security","description":"Demand for cloud operations and cybersecurity as-a-service shows no sign of letting up.

Cyber skills are in short supply and corresponding experience in cloud and cyber remains years out. Meanwhile the tech landscape continues to evolve at a dizzying pace, with explosive innovations like generative AI bringing new and unknown risks for companies struggling to keep pace with developments.   \n\nFor Managed Service Providers (MSPs) this creates a perfect opportunity to meet growing demand by adding cloud security to your services portfolio, providing additional value to new and existing clients, and generating more revenue in a persistently gloomy economy.  \n\nFor managed service and value add players, three key factors are at play: \n\n* **Organizations are struggling to hire technical talent** – this includes both cloud expertise and cybersecurity expertise \n* **Organizations are already bought into the as-a-Service delivery model** – this includes operational services as well as applications/software \n* **Organizations are desperate for education in cybersecurity** – this includes both established companies undergoing a digital transformation into an unfamiliar environment and young companies that don’t have the budget or the resources to skill up \n\n## Technology adoption is outpacing in-house capabilities \n\nIndustry association and advisory firm the Technology & Services Industry Association (TSIA) makes the root of the demand for these cyber skills very clear in its [State of Managed Services 2023](https://www.tsia.com/resources/the-state-of-managed-services-2023?) report, when it points out that today, *every* company is a technology company.  \n\nThere was a time when ‘technology companies’ stood alone from the financial companies, healthcare companies, or media companies. Now all companies in all sectors share one common thread evident in the emergence of new sector-specific innovators, such as fintechs and healthtechs, and that common thread is adoption of the cloud.   \n\nThe rapid adoption of cloud technology has had a significant knock-on effect however, in that it has become common practice to leverage IT outsourcing or managed services to support a shortfall in internal skills. \n\nThe great promise of the cloud was to enable everything on-demand, but in delivery, the speed of innovation has far outpaced most companies’ ability to keep up. This means external support is sought to help with cost reduction, risk aversion, transition from capital expenditure (CapEx) to operating expenditure (OpEx), or to try and accelerate return on investment in that technology.  \n\nAs a result, over 50% of respondents in S&P Global/451 Research's [Voice of the Enterprise: Cloud, Hosting & Managed Services, Managed Services 2022](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/managed-services-market-forecast-managed-cloud-services-coming-to-the-fore) survey said they currently relied on managed service providers to support their cloud environments. And this appetite is growing. \n\nApplication services including cybersecurity; operational services; and disaster recovery (backup and archiving) ranked as the top three managed services deployed in conjunction with public cloud deployments. \n\nFurthermore, managed services for cloud are not seen as a stopgap measure but as a long-term solution, with 73% of those companies currently using managed services for cloud apps and data, expecting to rely more on managed services over time. And nearly nine in 10 agree that managed\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/resources/empowering-mssps.pdf\"><img src=\"/img/cloud-security-mssps-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Get the Cyscale Cloud Security Platform for MSSPs Datasheet\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:33.75rem;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n## From MSP to MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider) \n\nWhere the purpose of an MSP approach is to make IT systems or functions run smoother while adhering to security best practices, an MSSP’s mission is to zero-in on the security aspect and improve the operation of a business environment by directly seeking out, identifying, and mitigating risk.  \n\nAs a specialized third party, an MSSP can alleviate the strain on IT teams, as well as provide necessary skills and insight to support and expand operations. A typical MSSP portfolio might include: \n\n* Managed firewall \n* Intrusion detection \n* Virtual Private Network (VPN) \n* Vulnerability scanning \n* Antivirus \n* Cloud security \n\nIn order to best capitalize on the opportunity, MSSPs actively seek to provide clients with real-time threat detection, response, and remediation services. A successful MSSP approach requires: \n\n* The right portfolio of tools that can not only deliver what the customer demands, but in a way that is effective and efficient for the MSSP \n* Experienced operational and technical staff with the right skill sets to operate on behalf of multiple end clients through comprehensive procedures and protocols \n* A Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor, prevent, detect, investigate, and remediate cyber threats 24/7 \n* A commitment to the MSSP business model \n\nThese last two points go hand-in-hand. According to Computer Weekly’s Evolving Landscape of the MSP Business 2023 report, the most in-demand products are a mix of cybersecurity and cloud solutions, with 85% of MSP respondents seeing an increasing need to offer full-fledged solutions such as SOC as-a-service. This is because under-resourced organizations are looking for end-to-end coverage, including risk prevention, detection, and remediation when it comes to cloud security.  \n\nFor those that already have a comprehensive portfolio, the rewards are bountiful, with the same report finding that MSPs are expecting average growth of 33% in 2023. \n\nIn combining the two biggest revenue drivers – cloud and security - the approach with most opportunity for established and budding MSSPs is to use lightweight agentless scanning solutions to build an inventory of the customer’s cyber-estate and surface actionable issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other risks. Then use this information to sell remediation services.  \n\nContinuous monitoring of the estate can make this an ongoing relationship, and a repeat revenue generator covering the full spectrum of threat prevention, detection, and remediation.  \n\n**Unlock new revenue streams with Cyscale's MSSP Cloud Security Platform**\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">LEARN MORE</button></a></div>\n\n## Where technology goes, risk follows \n\nFor customers with multi- and hybrid-cloud infrastructures, there is also the opportunity for an MSSP with a well put together service package to deliver a layer of abstraction that reduces the complexity for customers working across multiple dashboards and interfaces.  \n\nAWS claims that around 75% of its top 2,000 customers use AWS Security Hub as the central platform to consolidate security findings from their AWS cloud environments. But AWS faces growing competition from cloud rivals Microsoft and Google, both of which have invested heavily in their own cloud-native offerings. \n\nThe point is that with every cloud provider taking its own unique approach, organizations need extensive resources in terms of people and skills to manage these increasingly complex systems, each with their own native tools. An AWS security expert is not an Azure security expert, and the effort to remain an AWS ‘expert’ is not inconsiderable for a small company. This makes an independent third-party with multi-cloud tools and multi-cloud expertise a very attractive proposition.  \n\nCyscale can confirm that almost 50% of our inbound enquiries over 2023 have come from MSPs and MSSPs looking to add or expand their cloud security offerings with comprehensive coverage for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes, and multi-client management through a single pane of glass features as a top priority.  \n\n## Capitalizing on the MSSP opportunity \n\nIn The State of Technology Services 2023, the TSIA notes that managed services is one of the top three growth engines within the tech industry, boasting a sustainable margin and double-digit operating income. \n\nOne of the key drivers here, especially for cybersecurity as-a-service, is more awareness at the board level that security is a critical investment to make. This is compounded by worsening talent issues due to today's complex economic environment, and short-staffed teams that must find ways to do more with less. \n\nFor those ready to grab the opportunity, the path to profitable as-a-service solutions is through a managed as-a-service offer that can be standardized in order to become scalable, repeatable, and profitable. \n\nFor organizations operating in the cloud with limited time and security resources, simple and effective security must be a priority, and MSSPs equipped with a comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity and data management solutions are uniquely positioned to solve this challenge for repeat clients. \n\n## Drive new business with a cloud security assessment  \n\nMSSPs can create new business opportunities by using the Cyscale cloud security platform to offer up-front assessments of a customer or prospect’s entire cloud estate.  \n\nA fully automated security assessment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Kubernetes assets will provide you with comprehensive insights into your clients’ infrastructure vulnerabilities in a matter of minutes. \n\nAn easy-to-understand report can then be used to make the case for additional remediation and monitoring services to both technical stakeholders such as CTOs, CISOs, and security engineers, as well as more business-minded executives such as CFOs and CEOs. Use the assessment as leverage to improve your customers’ cloud security posture or to deliver evaluation or auditing services. \n\nWith in-app support for dozens of compliance standards, including CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST and more, you can also perform automated evaluations for customers who need to prove compliance.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLxIoTANSH0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n**Interested in discussing Cyscale’s Cloud Security Platform for MSPs and MSSPs?**\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A CALL</button></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Cloud Security Assessment as a Vital Part of the M&A Process","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Assessment as a Vital Part of the M&A Process","description":"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that involve the consolidation of cloud assets open all parties up to financial, regulatory, and reputational risk.

This is why effective cyber due diligence is essential for all involved, including situations where there will not be a merging or integration of systems, such as with the acquisition of a firm by private equity (PE) for example.  \n\n## Technology: Opportunity or risk? \n\nIn recent years mindsets have shifted, and companies no longer see technology as a cost of doing business as part of the M&A process, but instead as a way of accelerating growth or getting ahead in a market.  \n\n[PWC notes that technology is empowering CEOs to digitalise and transform businesses,](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html) and AI has changed the game, with a disruptive impact that will create M&A opportunities as both corporates and private equity firms move to acquire new businesses or potentially exit them to monetize returns.  \n\n“We’ve been seeing for some time the growing skills challenge faced by organisations driving acquisition strategies. AI has upped the game here too, with AI talent being one of the scarcest resources to find,” PWC said in its 2023 mid-year update on Global M&A Industry Trends. \n\n[According to Accenture,](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/mapping-dna-mergers-acquisitions-value) 74% of CEOs see tech integration in M&A as a growth enabler or source of competitive advantage, but only 21% say tech due diligence was conducted for most of their deals over the past three years (to 2022).  \n\nThe obvious issue here becomes even more clear when the same report finds that 96% of CIOs have seen tech due diligence uncover issues or opportunities that made a material impact on the deal.  \n\n## Cybersecurity due diligence in M&A \n\nIt seems to be the case that one aspect that's often overlooked, yet fundamentally critical in the M&A process, is comprehensive planning for the integration of IT systems, including cloud environments.  \n\nIt’s possible that lack of education plays a role here, especially in cases where a company is being acquired for its technology by a more established acquirer built on legacy systems looking to keep pace with the market.  \n\nWhile it may not look complicated from the outside, it is not the case that merging two cloud-based organizations, even when both are using the same cloud provider, will ease the integration.  \n\nThe same is true when the merger will create a hybrid environment mixing on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.  \n\nEither way, integrating a new cloud environment can introduce a lot of new misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in both directions. This article intends to explore why the M&A process needs to be addressed as a cloud security challenge just as much, if not more, as an operational challenge. \n\n## Approaching cybersecurity proactively during M&A  \n\nIdeally, a full cybersecurity audit, including cloud security, will be carried out as part of the due diligence phase of a merger or acquisition. And in cases where there is to be a merging of infrastructure, an audit should again be carried out on day zero of the integration. \n\nThe negative consequences of failing to comprehensively assess your cloud security include: \n\n* Reputational risks and damage to brand \n* Increased costs down the road, either from the integration itself, lost revenue, or fines for compliance failings or security breaches \n* Failure to comply with existing or newly acquired compliance overheads, regional laws and regulations, resulting in fines or increased spend  \n* Overlooked or lost intellectual property, especially relevant due to the boom in AI and associated tech IP \n* Customer impact including increased friction and churn due to broken or problematic systems \n\n## Common misconceptions when integrating a new cloud environment  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n* **We both use the same cloud platform so the integration will be easy:** Unique configurations, architectures, and approaches mean that no two cloud environments are alike, even on the same platform. \n* **We’re mostly on-prem so it’s just adding a new technology:** The cloud is a wildly different environment to anything that has come before and even now there is a significant shortage of experience and expertise in the market. Many security problems arise from a lack of education about how to operate safely in the cloud.  \n* **We will audit the cloud environment at a later date:** Due to its public nature, security incidents in the cloud happen in real time. A new zero-day vulnerability in a common software package can be exploited on a mass scale hours after being revealed. A DevOps team spinning up a new instance with a misconfiguration can open your entire infrastructure up to risk. Cloud security posture has to be monitored constantly.  \n* **We can rely on our existing toolset or expertise:** The difference from one cloud platform to another is considerable. They even use different terminology. An expert in AWS is not necessarily an expert in Azure, and security tools may not comprehensively cover multiple environments. The introduction of another cloud is the introduction of another risk, and another visibility challenge.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>\n\n## Cloud security risks that come with an M&A event: Real examples \n\n### Data leakage \n\nWhen moving data from one cloud service provider to another, mistakes are bound to happen. In one case a company was moving some sensitive files from AWS S3 buckets to an Azure Storage Account.  \n\nDuring the migration, the team utilized Shared Access Signatures (SAS) in Azure to control access to the stored data. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of the migration process, the team hastily generated SAS tokens with overly broad permissions. \n\nInstead of applying fine-grained access controls to specific resources or limiting access to authorized personnel, the tokens granted broader read and write permissions across a wider range of containers or blobs within the Azure Storage Account. \n\nThis misconfiguration inadvertently exposed sensitive data, including financial records and proprietary algorithms. \n\n**Solution:** Even though a migration can be daunting, take it step by step and understand the [best practices of cloud resources](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) you’re using so you can make informed decisions. For example, in the case of storage accounts in Azure, a recommendation is to use RBAC (Role-based access control), rather than SAS signatures.  \n\nIt’s not enough to understand the technology you’ve been using to date, you also need to have a good grasp of the new cloud provider you’re integrating with as every cloud’s approach is different.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\"><img src=\"/img/data-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n### Attempting integration of incompatible systems \n\nHarmonizing disparate IT systems, particularly cloud environments, is a formidable challenge in M&A events. Incompatible technologies can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit.  \n\nIn one case two companies performed encryption for PII differently, and when they ultimately had to merge the sensitive data from two different repositories, the data had to be decrypted and then re-encrypted in a unified manner. This opened up the possibility of several risks – what happens to the data while it’s unencrypted? And where is it stored?  \n\n**Solution:** When it comes to sensitive data, such as PII, time is of the essence but it’s more important to do the work properly, so don’t rush to process it and skip steps. \n\nMinimize the time data is unencrypted. Decrypt the data only when necessary for the merge and re-encrypt it promptly after the process is complete. Moreover, perform the decryption and re-encryption within a secure, controlled environment with restricted access. Use encrypted communication channels and isolated systems to prevent unauthorized access to the unencrypted data. \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\">\n  <img src=\"/img/encryption-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:32.0625rem;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'> See how Cyscale solved this challenge by revealing encryption status for data <br class=\"hidden lg:block\">\n    and identifying misconfigurations in data stores</span>\n</a>\n\n### Lack of visibility into the extended cloud estate \n\nOne of the big problems that often appears during or after a merger or an acquisition is the lack of visibility into the new or extended cloud estate. When you have to deal with complex infrastructures and unknown environments, security issues can creep in without you noticing. Roles or permissions that should be onboarded or offboarded, redundant VMs that have to be deprovisioned, storage resources that have to be deleted, these are just some examples of cloud resources that may change during an M&A.  \n\nWithout great visibility into a changing environment, mistakes are bound to happen. \n\n**Solution:** To gain much-needed visibility in the cloud, have an active inventory of all your cloud resources and assets, and ideally, the context of how they all interconnect. There are tools which will automatically scan your estate and build an inventory, and some use dashboards to help visualize your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) even across multiple clouds. \n\nFurthermore, perform access reviews to thoroughly understand the permissions users have and whether they are overprovisioned or even redundant.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#inventory\">\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'>See how Cyscale gives you full visibility of your cloud estate by revealing all assets \n    and their issues in minutes</span>\n</a>\n\n### Expanding compliance and regulatory challenges \n\nM&A events can often cross multiple geographic or legal jurisdictions, each with its own set of compliance requirements. Ensuring alignment with these diverse regulatory landscapes can be a daunting task, and failure to meet compliance standards can lead to severe penalties and legal consequences. \n\nFor example, for some companies, data sovereignty is an important aspect. This means that some companies, due to compliance requirements, have to store all data related to a specific geography on that country’s territory. If one organization acquired another to get access to a new market, they must ensure continued compliance with data sovereignty requirements in the event of merging of infrastructure or face possible legal battles and substantial fines.  \n\nCommon examples include the applicability of US State Privacy Laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other state-specific laws. Or the applicability of EU/UK GDPR and other international laws, all of which highlight the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of regulatory environments and meticulous due diligence in M&A scenarios. \n\n**Solution:** When an M&A event happens, ensure that you understand the compliance requirements related to all parties and create a detailed plan to minimize any disruption from the merger or integration process.  \n\nIn terms of data sovereignty, this means understanding how to store data in the country where it’s supposed to be stored.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#compliance\">\n    <img src=\"/img/compliance-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:38.563rem;height:auto;\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='block text-center'>See how Cyscale helps you comply with dozens of standards out of the box\n    and offers support for custom controls</span>\n</a>\n\n### See how we build an asset inventory in this video\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQj8Yo71DvQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n## Approaching cloud security in M&A holistically  \n\nAlthough the considerations set out in this article make an M&A event seem daunting, going into the process with an understanding of what to look out for is half the battle. Proper planning and a comprehensive assessment of your cloud infrastructure(s) during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merge will ensure the process runs smoothly and safely. \n\nThe Cyscale platform is designed to help close these security gaps by providing continuous visibility, security controls, and a single dashboard through which to assess your security posture across multiple clouds, including policies and compliance.  \n\n### Preparing for M&A with a cloud security assessment \n\nThe Cyscale cloud security platform is an agentless cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that can help you assess risk during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merger and integration.  \n\n<strong id=\"inventory\">Inventory</strong>\n\nTo start with, a fully automated security assessment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Kubernetes assets will provide you with comprehensive insights into your partner’s cloud estate, including all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, in a matter of minutes.  \n\nThis will give you a full asset inventory and flag any urgent issues that need to be addressed. The Cyscale Graph View means that misconfigurations are analyzed in context, automatically correlating issues that affect compute, data storage and identity assets, determining their real impact on data security and helping prioritize remediation efforts. \n\n<strong id=\"data\">Data</strong>\n\nThe assessment will also identify all data stores and give you valuable information about encryption status for data at rest, encryption keys, as well as identifying any object containers and databases with issues, such as public access, permissive access policies, or lack of deletion protection.  \n\nThis can help ensure your crown jewels are protected, prevent data leakage, and ensure solid foundations for tasks like merging encrypted databases.  \n\n<strong id=\"compliance\">Compliance</strong>\n\nIn terms of both planning the integration work and having ongoing proof of compliance, Cyscale has in-app support for dozens of compliance standards, including CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST and more. \n\nAll these compliance standards and controls are analyzed within the Cyscale app, taking into account the unique cloud infrastructures and their related vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nThis consolidates your reputation as a transparent, data-focused organization that proves to customers, auditors, and regulatory compliance bodies how robustly it protects Personally Identifiable Information (PII). \n\nAn easy-to-understand report can then be used to make the case for additional funding or remediation requirements, for both technical stakeholders such as CTOs, CISOs, and security engineers, as well as more business-minded executives such as CFOs, CEOs or the Board.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/request-demo/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image'/>\n</a>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"The Next Era of Security Scoring: CVSS 4.0 vs CVSS 3.1 and What You Need to Know","seoTitle":"CVSS 4.0 vs CVSS 3.1 and What You Need to Know","description":"The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) officially launched CVSS 4 in early November.

It is probably the world’s most used scoring system for [vulnerabilities](https://cyscale.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-kubernetes-secrets-risk/), and, despite its updates over the years, it has had its shortcomings.  \n\nCVSS 3.0, updated to CVSS 3.1 in 2019, was the most recent and popular version in use for the last eight years. But in early November the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) [officially launched CVSS 4](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/index.html) This version promises to address many of the shortcomings of its predecessors.  \n\nLet’s see how CVSS 4 revolutionizes how we look at vulnerabilities and why it’s been a long time coming. \n\n## Timeline of CVSS updates \n\n* February 2005: CVSS Version 1 appears. This version received much criticism due to its ambiguous metric system \n* June 2007: CVSS version 2 is launched, this time with less inconsistencies. \n* June 2015: CVSS version 3.0 is published, introducing the concept of “Scope” to mark a difference between separate components of a system \n* June 2019: CVSS version 3.1 clarified concepts and introduced new metrics, making the new CVSS score easier to use \n* 2023: CVSS version 4.0 is released.  \n\nNotice how it's been over eight years since CVSS version 3.0 appeared. And while it had a patch four years in with 3.1, it still had problems.   \n\n## The shortcomings of CVSS 3.0 and 3.1 \n\nLack of granularity was a big challenge for CVSS 3.0 and 3.1. The flat scoring allowed for two vulnerabilities that impacted an IT system differently to be scored the same. For example, a vulnerability that allowed remote code execution without authentication could have been ranked the same as one that required local access with elevated privileges. While both can lead to disaster in a company, the former poses a higher risk due to its potential exploitation.  \n\n[Temporal metrics](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/cvss-v31-specification_r1.pdf) did not have a significant impact on the CVSS score. The three temporal metrics were: \n\n* Exploit code maturity, which refers to the stage of the exploit (whether it’s “functional” or “proof-of-concept”, for example), \n* Remediation level, which measures the quality of available patches or mitigation (some values included “unavailable”, “workaround”, and “official fix”), \n* Report confidence, or the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the supplied technical details, with values like “reasonable” or “unknown”. \n\nThe scoring accuracy was also debatable. Often, vulnerabilities were ranked over 7.0 (High or Critical), which meant people frequently saw high-severity vulnerabilities. And while the impact of such vulnerabilities can’t be denied, desensitization became a problem. An accurate score is more important than marking everything as critical, which meant better metrics were needed.  \n\n## So what’s changed with CVSS 4? \n\n[According to FIRST](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/index.html) (The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), the entity that manages CVSS, version 4.0 has a finer granularity, achieved by introducing new base metrics and values, which allow for a better scoring system: \n\n* The new Base metric, Attack Requirements (AT), measures the conditions that have to be met for an attack to be possible (basically, how many things need to go wrong before an attack is possible), \n* New Base metric values: User Interaction (UI), which captures if a human is needed (besides the [attacker](https://cyscale.com/blog/compromising-azure-cloud-as-guest/)) to compromise a vulnerable system. The possible values are None (N), Passive (P), and Active (A). For example, if a user needs to give permissions deliberately for the attack to be possible, the User Interaction is Active. \n\nAs we can see, these important metrics allow for a better scoring system for vulnerabilities.  \n\nExploit Maturity (E) now measures more accurately the likelihood of the vulnerability to be exploited; it is a temporal metric based on the current state of the exploitation techniques. This temporal metric allows the CVSS score to reflect the severity of a vulnerability in real-time. Remediation Level and Report Confidence have been retired, and the new threat metrics are more accessible to follow and understand. \n\nEnvironmental metrics allow for more customized and specific vulnerability assessments because they take into consideration the conditions and setups of companies’ environments. This is a “feature” that the previous versions of CVSS lacked. Environmental metrics include: \n\n* Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Requirements (CR, IR, AR), which are metrics that allow companies to assign an adequate importance to each factor. For example, if the integrity of data is of utmost importance, they can rate IR as High and the others as Medium or Low, \n* Safety is a metric that shows the impact on human lives. For example, if a vulnerability were to cause a fintech organization business disruption and financial losses, the Safety of that vulnerability could be assessed as Negligible, in comparison to the same one affecting a healthcare organization where life is put in danger, in which case Catastrophic would be a much more appropriate score. \n\n## The relation between CVSS and EPSS: Brothers in arms \n\nAnother scoring system - EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) - is designed to predict the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the future. It aims to forecast the probability that a vulnerability will be used in a successful attack, helping security teams anticipate and prepare for potential threats.  \n\nIn conjunction with CVSS, EPSS can help prioritize the vulnerability remediation efforts. \n\nEPSS typically considers various factors, including: \n\n* the vulnerability's exploitability,  \n* presence of known exploits,  \n* trends in threat actor behavior, and  \n* historical data to predict the likelihood of exploitation.  \n\n## Benefits of CVSS 4.0\n\nIt is important to understand that CVSS version 4.0 does not apply retroactively. Only the vulnerabilities discovered after the release of CVSS 4.0 will receive the new scoring. \n\nThe new CVSS version 4.0 will bring much sought after value to companies trying to assess their security posture. At Cyscale, we display the CVSS and the EPSS scores to help users better understand their cloud environment. We show the CVSS score of vulnerabilities to highlight which ones should be prioritized. By factoring in the CVSS value, which is now much more relevant, we can help organizations understand risks more accurately and highlight [cloud security infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) improvements with the highest impact and the lowest level of effort required. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cve-screen.png\" alt=\"CVE vulnerability info card in Cyscale\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Critical Confluence Authorization Vulnerability Actively Exploited","seoTitle":"Critical Confluence Authorization Vulnerability Actively Exploited","description":"Atlassian has warned that as of November 6th it has observed 'several active exploits' and reports of threat actors using ransomware in association with a critical Improper Authorization Vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server.","seoDescription":"Atlassian warns of  active exploits and threat actors using ransomware in critical Improper Authorization Vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server.","date":"2023-11-08T11:55:39.247Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"critical-authorization-vulnerability-confluence-exploited","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/2c0f5/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/41be8/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.jpg 205w,\n/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/c78f7/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.jpg 410w,\n/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/2c0f5/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/913d0/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.webp 205w,\n/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/91660/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.webp 410w,\n/static/d806873ee5f93307e67b021fd9e0128e/888e2/confluence-criticalvuln-exploit.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"Atlassian has warned that as of November 6th it has observed 'several active exploits' and reports of threat actors using ransomware in association with a critical Improper Authorization Vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server. \n\nCVE-2023-22518, first published on October 31st, 2023, is a Confluence vulnerability that affects all pre-existing versions of Data Center and Server. It was initially assigned a CVSS score of 9.1, which was increased to 10, the maximum, on November 6th.  \n\nThis is the [second critical vulnerability](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22515-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1295682276.html) in Atlassian Data Center and Server discovered in the same month, alongside CVE-2023-22515.   \n\n## Confluence Improper Authorization vulnerability in detail \n\nThis vulnerability occurs due to Improper Authorization. The bug enables the attacker to: \n\n* reset a Confluence instance, and to \n* create a Confluence instance administrator account. \n\nThis means the attacker can either reset the entire instance, causing the company to lose data unless it is backed up, or they can steal the data by creating an administrator account.   \n\n### What you need to do: mitigation of the Confluence Improper Authorization vulnerability \n\nSince all versions prior to the attack are affected, [Atlassian urges users](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html) to immediately patch to the new versions released:  \n\n* 7.19.16, \n* 8.3.4, \n* 8.4.4, \n* 8.5.3, \n* 8.6.1. \n\nIf patching is not possible straight away, remove the instance from being publicly accessible. This is a temporary measure that allows you to gain time by limiting the attack surface – if your instance is not Internet-facing, attackers cannot reach it as easily. \n\nBesides this, it is recommended to back-up your instance. \n\nIf you cannot patch the instance and remove it from the internet, you can apply the following temporary solutions, which you can also find on [Atlassian’s page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html): \n\nBlock access to the following endpoints: \n\n* /json/setup-restore.action \n* /json/setup-restore-local.action \n* /json/setup-restore-progress.action \n\nTo do that, on each node, modify /<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml and add the following block of code (just before the </web-app> tag at the end of the file): \n\n```\n<security-constraint>\n\t\t<web-resource-collection>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-local.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<url-pattern>/json/setup-restore-progress.action</url-pattern>\n\t\t\t<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>\n\t\t</web-resource-collection>\n\t<auth-constraint />\n</security-constraint>\n```\n\nThen, restart your instance.   \n\n### How do you know if you were affected? \n\nIf you cannot login anymore, it could be a sign that your Confluence instance has been compromised. Besides this, look out for: \n\n* requests to /json/setup-restore* in your logs, \n* installed unknown plugins (the malicious plugin web.shell.Plugin was reported, according to Atlassian), \n* corrupted data or encrypted files that were not encrypted before, \n* new and unexpected members of the confluence-administrators group, \n* new and unexpected user accounts. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/) surfaces assets affected by the Improper Authorization Vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Everything to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"HITRUST (Health Information Trust) Alliance is the organization that established the HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework), a framework for managing and securing information in the healthcare industry.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"High-severity Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","seoTitle":"Critical NGINX Ingress Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","description":"Three high-severity security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the NGINX Ingress controller for Kubernetes, which could put credentials and other secrets at risk of theft by threat actors.

These vulnerabilities have been assigned a CVSS score of 7.6 (the first two) and 8.6 (the third one), ranked HIGH. \n\nTo better understand how the vulnerabilities can be exploited, what the impact is on your cloud infrastructure and how they can be patched, let’s dive deeper: \n\n### What is an NGINX Ingress controller? \n\nThe ingress-NGINX controller is a [specialized load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) for Kubernetes and other containerized environments that accepts incoming traffic and routes it to Kubernetes pods. The NGINX Ingress controller is designed to be a central point of entry into a Kubernetes cluster adding a layer of abstraction to reduce routing complexity.  \n\nTo put it simply, it’s like a traffic policeman that tells all vehicles on a road where they are and are not allowed to go. \n\nAn ingress-NGINX controller is a specific implementation of an Ingress controller that uses the NGINX web server, which is known for its speed and efficiency.   \n\n### The 3 NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities in detail \n\n**CVE-2023-5043** \n\nAnnotations are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects in order to add additional information to those objects. \n\nDue to poor input sanitization, the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet can be used to inject command execution. \n\nThe “configuration-snippet” annotation, or metadata, allows users to inject custom configuration code into the NGINX configuration file. \n\n**CVE-2023-5044** \n\nThis vulnerability occurs for the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation. This annotation allows you to establish a permanent HTTP redirect (Return Code 301) by injecting arbitrary code via the annotation. As a result, the controller will redirect traffic to that path. \n\n**CVE-2022-4886** \n\nThis issue can be exploited by someone with create or update permissions on ingress API objects.   \n\nThe field spec.rules\\[].http.paths\\[].path allows you to specify where incoming requests to your applications should be routed based on the path in the URL. Since the input is not correctly sanitized, the attacker can specify an internal file as the path, obtaining the credentials of the controller. Thus, by exploiting the poor sanitization, the attacker gains access to sensitive data. \n\n### Impact of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nIngress controllers run with high privileges. By default, having access to the credentials of the ingress controller means you have access to all secrets in the cluster. As you can imagine, the impact of these vulnerabilities left unchecked can create significant risk for your data. So, it’s no surprise that the vulnerabilities described have been assigned such high CVSS scores.  \n\n### Mitigation of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nTo protect your cloud environment from these vulnerabilities, follow these steps: \n\n* for CVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044, update NGINX to version 1.19 and set the --enable-annotation-validation flag, \n* for CVE-2022-4886, change the pathType attribute of the controller to Exact or Prefix. This will allow only paths that start with “/” and contain alphanumeric characters, “-“, “_”, and additional “/”.  \n\n### The impact of NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities on cloud environments  \n\nThe next question is, are cloud environments impacted by these vulnerabilities? Yes! Many cloud environments run Kubernetes clusters with NGINX-ingress controllers. For a cloud-native company building software that heavily relies on Kubernetes and employs ingress-controllers, there are significant risks involved. If exploited, these bugs can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the cluster. \n\nMoreover, the ingress controller manages incoming traffic, so the disruption of such a critical component of an infrastructure can cause availability issues leading to downtime and possible financial losses. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) surfaces assets affected by the NGINX Ingress controller bugs as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated."}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":10,"currentPage":1,"category":"All","seoTitle":"Blog - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Cloud and Data Security Blog","categoriesList":["CNAPP","Cloud Security","News","Compliance","Product","IAM","CSPM","Cloud Native Security","Misconfigurations","Encryption"],"heading":"All you need to know about protecting SaaS apps and data in the cloud"}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","3550415407","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
