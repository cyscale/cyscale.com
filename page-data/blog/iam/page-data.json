This example combines \"What you know\" with \"What you have\".  \n\nHere are some of the controls implemented in Cyscale that check if MFA is configured for your cloud environment: \n\n* *Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users that have a console password* for AWS \n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all privileged users* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users* for Microsoft Azure \n\nSSO (Single Sign-On) should also be integrated in the authentication scheme to grant access to individual users across multiple environments using just one set of credentials. \n\n</div>\n\n### Rotate credentials and keys regularly \n\nThis best practice is recommended across all vendors and should be implemented in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nThis method helps minimize the impact if a key or a set of credentials is breached. \n\nIn the case of user credentials, passwords should be changed with new, different ones. \n\nWhen rotating keys, the old ones should be retired, and new keys should be generated. \n\nWe suggest that you rotate your keys and credentials at least every 90 days. \n\nSome examples of validation controls offered by Cyscale that check if credentials or keys are rotated regularly are: \n\n* *Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less* for AWS (Amazon Web Services) \n* *Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days* for Google Cloud\n* *Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or less* for AWS \n\nMoreover, a strong password policy should be implemented to prevent individuals from using weak passwords. \n\n### Comply with The Principle of Least Privilege \n\nConforming to The Principle of Lease Privilege is another essential best practice instilled in cloud security and recommended by the vendors we've discussed.  \n\nIn order to comply with this concept, you need to restrict user access to the least privileged access and eliminate all administrator and root user accounts that are not strictly necessary.  \n\nAWS recommends that you start setting up your policies with a minimum of possible permissions and add more on the go, if necessary, to correctly manage access control.  \n\nMake sure you're not missing anything when implementing the concept of least privilege by using controls offered by Cyscale that detect misconfigurations, like the ones below: \n\n* *Ensure that ServiceAccount has no Admin privileges* for Google Cloud\n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n\n### Assign permissions at group level  \n\nAnother best practice we recommend to ensure IAM Cloud Security is managing specific permissions at group level and not at the user level. \n\nWhenever you're adding a new user or trying to manage multiple users, assign them to a group with very well-defined rules and privileges. \n\nHere are some controls from Cyscale that check if you're implementing this IAM security best practice: \n\n* *Ensure IAM Users receive permissions only through Groups* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure IAM Policies are attached only to groups or roles* for AWS Cloud \n\n### Implement logging and monitoring \n\nAWS, Google Cloud, and Azure recommend that you implement logging and monitoring for your cloud environment. All three vendors provide these features.  \n\nFor AWS IAM, you can use one of the following IAM services: \n\n* AWS CloudTrail \n* Amazon CloudFront \n* Amazon CloudWatch \n* AWS Config \n* Amazon S3 \n\nGoogle Cloud supplies Cloud Audit Logs, a service that audits your IAM policy, access to cloud service account keys, and other components of Google Cloud. \n\nFor Azure, you can use Azure AD activity logs which can be supplemented by Azure Monitor logs to alert you on significant events. \n\nExamples of controls across all three cloud providers can be seen below: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs* for AWS \n* *Ensure that Diagnostic Logs are enabled for all services which support it* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud Audit Logging is configured properly across all services and all users from a project* for Google Cloud\n\nIdentity and Access Management is a crucial component of the cloud and should be adequately secured to prevent data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents. Reduce the attack surface by eliminating any vulnerabilities in the authentication process and keeping hackers away.\n\nUse Cyscale to identify any [misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) or gaps in your cloud infrastructure and secure it with our over 400 controls. \n\nIn the following article, we will look at [IAM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly.\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["IAM"],"title":"IAM Services in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud - A Cloud Industry Overview","seoTitle":"IAM Services in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud - a Cloud Industry Overview","description":"An industry overview of the IAM Services.

Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![Google Cloud IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.webp#shadow \"Google Cloud IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\nIn the following article, we will look at [IAM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"IAM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - IAM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale IAM","categoriesList":["News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","Compliance","IAM","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
