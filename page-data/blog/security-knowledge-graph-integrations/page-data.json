So, let's see how you can do it.\n\n## What is the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is a data model based on deep understanding that maps cloud assets and their relationships, as well as information from adjacent data sources to provide context-aware security and deliver a comprehensive security analysis over an organization. \n\n**Google uses a Knowledge Graph** to power the results of its search engine by keeping a database of billions of records. \n\nThat is how [Google](https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176?hl=en) is able to answer questions accurately with context. \n\nThe Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™ is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between all of your cloud assets, as well as other apps and systems that may affect cloud security posture, and automatically pinpoints security issues.  \n\nThe graph is more than just a way to visualize assets and systems; it uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities. \n\n## Why use a Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nYou could go through sets of configuration best practices and verify them against each cloud resource.  \n\nHowever, when looked at in isolation, a resource may be misconfigured, but the relations it has with other assets, as well as its position in the network (for example, if it’s in a private network or if it is Internet-facing) may greatly influence the criticality of the situation. \n\nThe Security Knowledge Graph™ is built on top of a graph database that contains nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns to create comprehensive graphs. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a Security Knowledge Graph™.  \n\nNotice how a very complex system with intricate relationships and hidden vulnerabilities is so much easier to understand and observe when looking at it in a graph. \n\n![The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](/img/2-general.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n## Are you unsure if you need the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nLet me show you why you do!  \n\nRead the following scenarios to see if you can find your company in any of the situations described.  \n\n### Scenario 1: HR and identity providers \n\nAn employee joins the company and is onboarded using an HR management tool, such as BambooHR or Workday. \n\nAn account is created for the employee using an identity provider such as [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/), through which they receive access to a production [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) account, GitHub, and many other sensitive applications that may end up having an effect on the company's cloud infrastructure. \n\nWhen the employee leaves the company, they are offboarded from the HR portal, and the human resources department thinks the employee's accounts were completely deprovisioned.  \n\nHowever, since the Okta administrator did not correctly deprovision his account, the former employee **still has access to production code**. \n\n![HR and identity providers scenario in a graph](/img/3-scenariu-1.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 2: Misconfigured permissions \n\nIt is not uncommon to have employees with very similar names within the same company. For example, assume user John Smith, a software developer, and Jonathan Smith, an accountant, are both employees at the same company. \n\nThey are mistaken for one another and instead of John, the software developer, it is Jonathan who receives the credentials instead, thus gaining access to a sensitive account.  \n\nWhile trying to understand the reasoning behind this, Jonathan explores the account and accidentally **deletes a resource from the cloud**. \n\n![Misconfigured permissions in graph](/img/4-scenariu-2.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 3: False positives in vulnerability scans \n\nA company uses Tenable or CrowdStrike, endpoint vulnerability scanners.  \n\nA virtual machine running an application with Log4J has the Log4Shell vulnerability. As a result, critical alerts are generated, and the software engineers will prioritize this issue over other current vulnerabilities. \n\nHowever, Log4J is only running in a private network, not accessible from the Internet. The issue still needs to be addressed, but the severity is high instead of critical. \n\n**Instead of securing Internet-facing applications and devices, engineers are distracted by less essential tasks** due to contextless alerts. \n\n![False positives in vulnerability scans](/img/5-scenariu-3.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nKeep in mind that these are some examples. There are plenty of other situations where contextual awareness is the best way to notice existing vulnerabilities before they become breaches. \n\n  \n\n[Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) is leading a continuous effort to integrate as many services and tools as possible and expand the Knowledge Graph to cover a great range of security scenarios. \n\nWe currently integrate with: \n\n* AWS (Amazon Web Services), \n* Google Cloud, \n* Microsoft Azure, \n* Alibaba Cloud, \n* Okta, and others. \n\nThere are many more integrations to come soon: AWS SSO, GitHub, Azure AD, Kubernetes, GSuite. \n\n![Integrations in Cyscale](/img/6-tabel.webp#shadow \"Integrations in Cyscale\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Cloud Security"],"title":"SMEs Face Security Pressure with Too Many Tools, Not Enough Skills","seoTitle":"SMEs face security pressure with too many tools, not enough skills","description":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","seoDescription":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","date":"2024-02-29T13:31:28.294Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"sme-security-pressure-too-many-tools-not-enough-skills","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/sme-security-pressure.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png","srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/ac644/sme-security-pressure.png 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/89b47/sme-security-pressure.png 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/913d0/sme-security-pressure.webp 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/91660/sme-security-pressure.webp 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/888e2/sme-security-pressure.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Security concerns are on the rise as the greatest challenge for IT admins at SMEs in Q1 2024, with 56% revealing that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture today than they were in April 2023.  \n\nAccording to [JumpCloud’s Q1 2024 SME IT Trends report](https://jumpcloud.com/resources/q1-2024-it-trends-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes), which surveyed IT stakeholders in UK, US, and India, the implication is that SMEs could be more vulnerable to cyber-attack than other segments. The report highlighted concerns over security amid a shortage of specialist skills and additional pressure on IT teams around compliance, with over two-thirds (75%) saying that more compliance and regulation requirements have been mandated in their region. \n\nThese concerns are backed up by long term trends in compliance. The International Organization for Standardization, which maintains the framework for ISO27001, said in its most recent report that certifications for ISO27001 increased 51% between 2020 to 2022 as more companies bowed to pressure from their own customers to prove security hardening and compliance.  \n\n## AI adoption is adding fuel to the fire \n\nWhile AI is seen by some as a cost-effective way of plugging the skills gap left by sweeping layoffs and a general lack of experienced professionals in specific sectors (such as security and cloud), IT admins tasked with integrating AI appear less confident, JumpCloud found.  \n\nDespite a mostly positive attitude toward AI in their organization, admins also report significant unease around AI’s impact on organizational security, with nearly two-thirds (62%) agreeing that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall. \n\n## Too many tools to be effective\n\nAnother challenge, compounded by a lack of manpower to carry out tasks, is that IT admins find themselves juggling too many tools to do their job.  \n\nThe vast majority (75%) of global respondents continue to prefer a single tool for a specific job rather than several-point solutions, roughly the same as the 77% who said the same in April 2023.  \n\n## MSPs come out on top \n\nBut this is all good news for Managed Service Providers, which continue to be a go-to resource for organizations under pressure.  \n\nNearly 76% rely on an MSP for at least some features and the trend is that organizations are leaning on MSPs for increased responsibilities, where SMEs are lacking the skills or the tools, or the ability to use the tools effectively.  \n\nThe survey found that an MSP completely manages the IT environment for 42% of respondents in UK, US, and India, versus 27% in April 2023—a 56% increase over 12 months. \n\nTellingly, security is the most common function for which organizations use MSPs (57% in 2024 versus 53% in April 2023), and the most popular reason why is that SMEs believe MSPs are up to date on the latest technologies (65%, up from 61% in April 2023), suggesting that smaller organizations are plugging the skills gap for complex subjects like security, cloud, and AI, with outsourcing.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Unlock New Revenue Streams With<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale Cloud Security for MSPs</span> \n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div> \n\n## Aggregation of tools and automation as the solution \n\nThese trends that JumpCloud has highlighted in the SME sector align closely with what we are hearing from the market and our own SME customer base.\n\nWhen it comes to cloud security specifically, IT admins and security professionals are struggling with multiple point solution tools that only apply to a single ecosystem. The cloud provider security tools only work for their own cloud, and skills for managing and securing that cloud are not transferable to another cloud either. This leaves SMEs struggling to meet security and compliance requirements and potentially losing business as a result.  \n\nSo, it comes as no surprise to see MSPs as the winners here. When small and medium businesses cannot get the skills in-house, but are seeing growing compliance pressures, they have no choice but to outsource the problem. What’s interesting is that MSPs and MSSPs face the same challenge, because the skills shortage is industry wide. But we work with a large number of managed service providers to help them unify their cloud security tools into a single platform and use automation to augment the security skills of their analysts to be transferable across all clouds and containerized environments. This means they can serve more customers with the same resources.\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Unifies Multiple<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cloud Security</span> Tools\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","seoTitle":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","description":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","seoDescription":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","date":"2024-02-27T14:48:18.017Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"container-escaping-leaky-vessels-docker-vulnerability","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/41be8/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/c78f7/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/913d0/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/91660/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/888e2/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"New vulnerabilities revealed in the runc command line tool could be exploited to allow attackers to escape containers and potentially get unauthorized access to the host operating system and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.  \n\n## What are the Leaky Vessels vulnerabilities? \n\nOn the 31st of January 2024, Snyk revealed four Docker container vulnerabilities with a critical security score ranging between 8.6 and 10. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

It’s not always by choice \n\nA multi-cloud strategy can combine the best of two (or more!) worlds, allowing cloud-native organizations to choose best-of-breed options for building apps and storing data in the cloud. At least this is true when the multi-cloud approach is by design.  \n\nIt’s not unheard of for a multi-cloud approach to happen by accident. Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","120001781","2024892666","2199015418","220583031","273821743","3058837307","3355083976","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
