But this year it’s different. \n\nThe rapid and unpredictable rise of AI has drawn attention through all of 2023, leading to questions about the positive and negative impact it will have on lives and businesses going forward.  \n\nThere’s no doubt AI-driven attacks will be a pivotal challenge that defines the cloud security landscape for 2024, but it’s not the only consideration characterized by intricate and cutting-edge vulnerabilities and attacks. \n\nLet's take a close look at the top 10 cloud security challenges we've identified in the last year that need to be closely monitored in 2024 and beyond. \n\n# 1. Advanced AI-driven threats \n\nThroughout 2023, AI exploded as a megatrend that changes the risk landscape significantly – both positively and negatively. We’ve seen AI-powered DDoS attacks, where attackers use automation to adjust threat vectors based on real-time analysis of success against various attack surfaces, and ransomware and malware that can adapt to the environment and replicate using existing and newly discovered vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe potential for generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is a double-edged sword, and the cloud security landscape feels uncertain as attackers come up with more and more sophisticated attacks. \n\nIn 2023, hackers managed to abuse the growing popularity of OpenAI's well-known tool, ChatGPT. [The chatbot was found to be \"hallucinating\"](https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk) in its responses to questions about coding packages and libraries and recommending things that didn't exist.  \n\nHackers went ahead and created malicious packages with the same names, so developers receiving the same recommendations from ChatGPT would download the malicious software. \n\nAlthough the threat is of great concern, it’s not all doom and gloom, according to Google Cloud’s own CISO. While it’s true we expect to see AI help attackers, AI should also give defenders a [significant advantage because AI is good at amplifying capability based on data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-how-the-ai-megatrend-can-help-manage-threats-reduce-toil-and-scale-talent) — and defenders have more data. \n\n## Protecting against AI-driven threats \n\nIn this rapidly changing field, continuous education regarding emerging AI-threats is vital. Awareness campaigns and training are the best weapons against these kinds of attacks. \n\nCloud security solutions such as [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) are also leading the application of AI to make cybersecurity more human friendly. As security practitioners are overwhelmed by information, making sense of that information in terms of context and inference is becoming more of a challenge.  \n\n Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant is a move towards making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\nOur platform can [automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues](https://cyscale.com/blog/introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant/) using the specific customers’ cloud footprint combined with LLMs of vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image'/>\n</a>\n\n# 2. Phishing and Social Engineering \n\nHuman behavior remains one of the staples in any list of risks, both as an external threat as well as an internal one due to disgruntled employees.  \n\nAs an external threat, phishing is still one of the most effective attacks. Humans are always the weak link in the security chain, and AI is making defending from social engineering attacks even harder due to the ease with which deep fakes can be produced that appear to be someone you know, to automated, convincing emails, messages, and chats with no grammar errors or that take on the tone and style of a specific person. \n\nIn the cloud, [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) (Identity and Access Management) is the first line of defense when focusing on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets. \n\nLeaked credentials and bypassed authentication processes are very dangerous and can lead to massive disasters, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. \n\n## Protecting against phishing and social engineering attacks \n\nTraining programs for social engineering attacks are necessary to prevent employees from falling for phishing scams.  \n\nEnforcing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is essential. Whether you’re using a passwordless solution or passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone and especially for high-privilege users.   \n\n# 3. Evolving regulatory frameworks \n\nAs technology advances, we see more and more updates and additions to [compliance laws and standards](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/) ensuring both businesses and customer data are adequately protected.  \n\nMaintaining compliance with the increasing complexity of frameworks and benchmarks can become overwhelming very quickly, especially for small teams.  \n\nFor example, in 2023, we saw multiple [updates to CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) for cloud services including Azure, AWS, and Kubernetes.  \n\nFor financial institutions, the implementation deadline for [DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) is also quickly approaching, with the release scheduled for early 2025 (17th of January). \n\nAll told, 2024 is a pivotal year for compliance and companies must keep up with the evolving regulations and maintain a good cloud security posture to protect themselves from emerging cybersecurity threats. \n\n## Maintaining compliance with cloud security regulations and standards \n\nBecause of the ever-changing landscape, staying on top of cloud security compliance is a continuous process that involves regular assessments of your cloud estate and compliance posture.  \n\nYou can keep up to date on new and changing requirements by [reading our blog posts.](https://cyscale.com/blog/compliance/) Furthermore, cloud security solutions like [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) can also help you keep track of your compliance progress and know where you’re standing. \n\n# 4. Quantum computing for password cracking \n\nWidely used encryption algorithms such as RSA were originally designed to withstand traditional computing attack methods, requiring a significant amount of computations to be made in order to crack passwords.  \n\nThe entire cryptographic landscape is currently based on this solution, with RSA protecting sensitive data everywhere. But developments in quantum computing keep advancing and threaten to make the impossible number of computations achievable.  \n\nAs a result, it’s expected that traditional encryption methods might one day become obsolete. The day quantum computing attacks will become possible is named Q-day, and it might be around the corner. \n\n## Protecting against quantum computing attacks \n\nIn parallel with developments in quantum computing, [quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms) or post-quantum cryptography are our only solutions at this time, and the first group of encryption tools that are designed to withstand the assault of a future quantum computer are in development.   \n\n# 5. Complexity in multi-cloud environments \n\nIt’s often said that the real killer in cloud security is the complexity. Cloud platforms and products have evolved in a granular fashion and security has followed suit. One often quoted Gartner prediction is that 99% of cloud security failures through 2025 will be due to user error as admins struggle to keep control of sprawling estates.\n\nCloud service providers offer menus of products and services running into the hundreds, each with their own security configuration, and in a multi-cloud environment this complexity is amplified.  \n\nManaging data security in multi-cloud environments can be especially challenging due to cloud providers' different configurations, security policies, even their vocabulary. As new tools appear, fully understanding a multi-cloud infrastructure can become harder. Remember, a certified AWS cloud expert is not an Azure cloud expert by default, and vice versa.   \n\n## Reducing complexity in multi-cloud environments\n\nBringing all your cloud assets, information, and configurations into one single platform is the key to not getting lost in your own cloud, and this means adopting a security strategy that includes a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) or a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) solution.   \n\nGartner research found that CSPM implementations can reduce cloud security incidents caused by misconfigurations by up to 80%. The single-pane-of-glass view across your multi-cloud estate also cuts down on the need to switch between multiple dashboards and means you can understand your entire cloud inventory in context.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/inventory-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 6. Cybersecurity alert fatigue \n\nStress and burnout are rampant among cybersecurity professionals and the impact of [user fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/) is no secret - thousands of alerts and logs that signal everything and anything that happens in the cloud is not a helpful approach. In many cloud security setups, the default process is to alert for every event, regardless of its criticality.  \n\nThis flood of alerts can quickly become overwhelming for cloud security professionals who become used to severe or critical alerts popping up every day. When everything is critical, nothing is. So, this can desensitize them, and when an actual breach occurs and legitimately critical alerts are sent out, they can end up being overlooked. \n\nThis approach can also turn into a resource hog, giving security practitioners an endless list of tasks to work through that might not achieve the desired results.  \n\n## Protecting against alert fatigue \n\nTo prevent user fatigue, contextual security is the best approach and your ability to prioritize remediation work efficiently depends on the capabilities of your [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) or [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nBy filtering out alerts that are not actually high risk in your unique cloud environment and shifting focus to your own most sensitive cloud resources, you can help your security people work more effectively.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/alerts-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 7. Executive decisions and responsibilities \n\nOne of the biggest challenges a CISO or CTO faces when approaching the board or C suite for funding is justifying their cybersecurity spend. There has long been a perception gap between the cost of security versus the cost of a breach and the simple truth is, you can spend some money up front to reduce the likelihood of a breach, or you can spend more later when the breach has happened.  \n\nThe [global average cost of a data breach has climbed 15% over the last three years](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs) and with lagging investment, only about one third of breaches are picked up by an organization’s own team.  \n\nFurthermore, we’ve seen how decisions made by individuals in executive positions make or break a company through their impact on the company's security strategy. Look at the [SolarWinds case](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/) as an example, where the SolarWinds CISO ended up being investigated for fraud over failure to fully disclose security gaps and issues in the company. \n\nThere’s also the issue of how those responsible for executing on the security strategy are impacted by executive decisions. The SEC investigation into SolarWinds found that “the volume of security issues being identified have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”   \n\n## Empowering security leaders to be effective \n\nAs increasing board liability for risk is sinking in, CTOs, CISOs, and security leaders should be looking to justify their security spend by aligning it with business goals, and instead of operating in a vacuum to build a culture of cybersecurity.  \n\nThis also means formulating policies and establishing processes (and actually following them!) is an approach that all companies need to be doing to ensure employees follow good practices and don't move away from established rules. \n\n# 8. Insider threats and privilege misuse \n\nSometimes, it's easy to focus on preventing unwanted access from external actors and forgetting that harm can also be done from the inside. Malicious or unintentional actions by employees with privileged access can pose significant security risks. \n\nEstimates vary but most research agrees that more than half of security breaches experienced are a result of internal threats or abuse of privilege. \n\n## Protecting against insider threats \n\nTo prevent against damage caused by current or previous employees, ensure that: \n\n* When offboarding users, you're removing all access and not leaving any dangling permissions that can be abused, \n* You're following the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only assigning the necessary permissions for the amount of time required, \n* You're monitoring user activity and performing regular assessments of user access and permissions. \n\n# 9. Cryptographic keys management \n\nManaging encryption keys effectively is critical for safeguarding data. With the growing volume of encrypted data in the cloud, ensuring secure storage, access, rotation, and revocation of encryption keys has become challenging. \n\nWhy is the way you store and manage cryptographic keys so important? A good example is the leak of 38TB of secrets that occurred in 2023, when a GitHub repository owned by Microsoft’s AI research division provided a link to a misconfigured Azure storage resource. \n\n[Microsoft AI Researchers exposed](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-ai-accidently-leaked-38tb/) crypto keys, passwords, and other data through a storage account that could be accessed using leaked SAS (Shared Access Signature) tokens. If encryption keys are leaked, the effort of encrypting data goes to waste. \n\nAnd it’s not just about protecting data but maintaining access to it. If an encryption key expires before it’s rotated out, you could end up losing access to precious data.  \n\n## Effective cryptographic keys management \n\nAs part of an effective CSPM approach, you need a solid crypto key management strategy. Cloud security platforms like Cyscale check a wide palette of settings using security controls across multiple cloud service providers to ensure keys on different platforms remain secure. \n\nA few examples are: \n\n* Ensure encryption keys are not expiring within the next 14 days \n* Ensure encryption keys don't have permissive access policies \n* Ensure in-use encryption keys are not scheduled for deletion \n* Ensure Cloud KMS cryptokeys are not anonymously or publicly accessible \n\n  <video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 10. Incident Response \n\nPreventative cybersecurity measures will only take you so far. Developing and implementing robust incident response plans specific to cloud environments is essential.  \n\nAccording to the [annual M-Trends report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/m-trends-2023) by Mandiant, part of Google, global median dwell time was down to 16 days in 2023 from 21 the year before, meaning attacks are being detected more quickly than ever before.  \n\nAlthough this decrease is in part down to better tools and better approaches by defenders, an explosion in ransomware is also driving this number down as the point of these attacks is to make themselves known for extortion purposes.  \n\nSo, when it comes to responding to an active incident, speed is of the essence.  \n\n## Effective incident response in cloud security \n\nGiven the volume of tasks and pressure on human resources, automation can take a lot of the toil out of triage, prioritization, and remediation when it comes to detecting and acting on incidents.  \n\nEffective coordination, timely response to security incidents, and comprehensive recovery strategies are vital for minimizing damage and restoring operations. \n\nFinally, while resumption of normal operations is the priority, care should also be taken to preserve evidence during the recovery and remediation phases. In some cases this may even be a regulatory requirement.  \n\n## Challenges and opportunities in 2024: Adapting amid technological shifts   \n\nThe challenges of 2024 bring forward a landscape where technological advancements intertwine with vulnerabilities, creating a need for adaptable and comprehensive security strategies.  \n\nAs we navigate AI-driven threats, the looming potential of quantum computing, and growing multi-cloud environments, hackers find ever-more innovative ways to attack companies, and so we must focus on fortifying our defenses, meaning proactive measures become imperative. \n\nTo prepare for this changing landscape, book a free cloud security health assessment with Cyscale.

The report highlighted concerns over security amid a shortage of specialist skills and additional pressure on IT teams around compliance, with over two-thirds (75%) saying that more compliance and regulation requirements have been mandated in their region. \n\nThese concerns are backed up by long term trends in compliance. The International Organization for Standardization, which maintains the framework for ISO27001, said in its most recent report that certifications for ISO27001 increased 51% between 2020 to 2022 as more companies bowed to pressure from their own customers to prove security hardening and compliance.  \n\n## AI adoption is adding fuel to the fire \n\nWhile AI is seen by some as a cost-effective way of plugging the skills gap left by sweeping layoffs and a general lack of experienced professionals in specific sectors (such as security and cloud), IT admins tasked with integrating AI appear less confident, JumpCloud found.  \n\nDespite a mostly positive attitude toward AI in their organization, admins also report significant unease around AI’s impact on organizational security, with nearly two-thirds (62%) agreeing that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall. \n\n## Too many tools to be effective\n\nAnother challenge, compounded by a lack of manpower to carry out tasks, is that IT admins find themselves juggling too many tools to do their job.  \n\nThe vast majority (75%) of global respondents continue to prefer a single tool for a specific job rather than several-point solutions, roughly the same as the 77% who said the same in April 2023.  \n\n## MSPs come out on top \n\nBut this is all good news for Managed Service Providers, which continue to be a go-to resource for organizations under pressure.  \n\nNearly 76% rely on an MSP for at least some features and the trend is that organizations are leaning on MSPs for increased responsibilities, where SMEs are lacking the skills or the tools, or the ability to use the tools effectively.  \n\nThe survey found that an MSP completely manages the IT environment for 42% of respondents in UK, US, and India, versus 27% in April 2023—a 56% increase over 12 months. \n\nTellingly, security is the most common function for which organizations use MSPs (57% in 2024 versus 53% in April 2023), and the most popular reason why is that SMEs believe MSPs are up to date on the latest technologies (65%, up from 61% in April 2023), suggesting that smaller organizations are plugging the skills gap for complex subjects like security, cloud, and AI, with outsourcing.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Unlock New Revenue Streams With<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale Cloud Security for MSPs</span> \n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div> \n\n## Aggregation of tools and automation as the solution \n\n“These trends that JumpCloud has highlighted in the SME sector align closely with what we are hearing from the market and our own SME customer base,” said Ovidiu Cical, CEO of Cyscale. \n\n“When it comes to cloud security specifically, IT admins and security professionals are struggling with multiple point solution tools that only apply to a single ecosystem. The cloud provider security tools only work for their own cloud, and skills for managing and securing that cloud are not transferable to another cloud either. This leaves SMEs struggling to meet security and compliance requirements and potentially losing business as a result.  \n\n“So, it comes as no surprise to see MSPs as the winners here. When small and medium businesses cannot get the skills in-house, but are seeing growing compliance pressures, they have no choice but to outsource the problem. What’s interesting is that MSPs and MSSPs face the same challenge, because the skills shortage is industry wide. But we work with a large number of managed service providers to help them unify their cloud security tools into a single platform and use automation to augment the security skills of their analysts to be transferable across all clouds and containerized environments. This means they can serve more customers with the same resources.”\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Unifies Multiple<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cloud Security</span> Tools\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","seoTitle":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","description":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","seoDescription":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","date":"2024-02-27T14:48:18.017Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"container-escaping-leaky-vessels-docker-vulnerability","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/41be8/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/c78f7/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/913d0/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/91660/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/888e2/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"New vulnerabilities revealed in the runc command line tool could be exploited to allow attackers to escape containers and potentially get unauthorized access to the host operating system and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.  \n\n## What are the Leaky Vessels vulnerabilities? \n\nOn the 31st of January 2024, Snyk revealed four Docker container vulnerabilities with a critical security score ranging between 8.6 and 10. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","120001781","2024892666","2199015418","220583031","273821743","3058837307","3355083976","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
