Entities that do not have the decryption key in their possession cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, read its content. \n\n## How does encryption work? \n\nPlaintext data is transformed, using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, to ciphertext, which is unreadable text.  \n\nThere are two types of encryption algorithms: \n\n* Symmetric,  \n* Asymmetric. \n\nIn symmetric algorithms, the key used to perform the encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt it and is, therefore, secret. \n\nExamples of symmetric algorithms are: \n\n* DES (Data Encryption Standard),  \n* 3DES (Triple DES), \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). \n\nThe latter one is, in 2022, the industry standard and is recommended to be used with 128 bits keys. \n\n![Symmetric encryption](/img/blog_17-cisco_encryption.webp#shadow \"Symmetric encryption\")\n\nImage source – cisco.com \n\nAsymmetric algorithms use two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. \n\nAsymmetric algorithm examples are: \n\n* RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), \n* ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). \n\nAsymmetric algorithms are not commonly used for encryption because they are slower. For example, the RSA algorithm requires keys between 1024 and 4096 bits, which slows down the encryption and decryption process.  \n\nThese algorithms can be used, however, to encrypt symmetric algorithm keys when they are distributed. \n\nA more common usage of asymmetric algorithms is digital signatures. They are mathematical algorithms that are used to cryptographically validate the authenticity and integrity of a message or media on the internet. \n\n## What is encryption used for? \n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality of data. The unreadable ciphertext keeps the data private from all parties that do not possess the decryption key. \n\nData has three states: \n\n* In motion, \n* In use, \n* At rest. \n\nIt is essential to understand these states and ensure that the data is always encrypted. It is not enough to encrypt data only when it is stored if, when in transit, a malicious party can still read it.  \n\nTherefore, we will look at encryption mechanisms for all three data states. \n\n### In Motion Encryption \n\nData in motion, or in transit, is data that is moved from one location to another, for example, between: \n\n* computers,  \n* services,  \n* virtual machines,  \n* applications, \n* networks.  \n\nExamples of data in motion are: \n\n* emails, \n* files, \n* messages. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nSSL/TLS ensure confidentiality through encryption. Firstly, a session is created between the two parties exchanging a message using asymmetric encryption. Then, after the secure session is established, symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt the data in motion. \n\nUsing one of the mentioned protocols prevents attackers from reading the data in motion. \n\nWebsites should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP to ensure encryption between websites and browsers. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS. \n\n**What is in motion data vulnerable to?** \n\n**Eavesdropping attacks.** In this situation, malicious entities can analyze traffic sent over the internet and read unencrypted data.   \n\n### In Use Encryption \n\nData currently accessed and used is considered in use.   \n\nExamples of in use data are: \n\n* files that are currently open, \n* databases, \n* RAM data. \n\nBecause data needs to be decrypted to become in use, it is essential that data security is taken care of before the actual use of data begins. \n\nTo do this, you need to ensure a good authentication mechanism. Technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be implemented to increase security. \n\nMoreover, after a user authenticates, access management is necessary. Users should not be allowed to access any available resources, only the ones they need to, in order to perform their job.  \n\nA method of encryption for data in use is Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory using an AES-128 encryption engine and an [AMD EPYC processor](https://developer.amd.com/sev/). Other hardware vendors are also offering memory encryption for data in use, but this area is still relatively new. \n\n**What is in use data vulnerable to?**  \n\nIn use data is vulnerable to **authentication attacks**. These types of attacks are used to gain access to the data by bypassing authentication, brute-forcing or obtaining credentials, and others. \n\nAnother type of attack for data in use is a **cold boot attack**. Even though the RAM memory is considered volatile, after a computer is turned off, it takes a few minutes for that memory to be erased. If kept at low temperatures, RAM memory can be extracted, and, therefore, the last data loaded in the RAM memory can be read. \n\n### At Rest Encryption \n\nOnce data arrives at the destination and is not used, it becomes at rest.  \n\nExamples of data at rest are: \n\n* databases, \n* cloud storage assets such as buckets, \n* files and file archives, \n* USB drives, and others. \n\nThis data state is usually most targeted by attackers who attempt to read databases, steal files stored on the computer, obtain USB drives, and others. \n\nEncryption of data at rest is fairly simple and is usually done using symmetric algorithms. When you perform at rest data encryption, you need to ensure you’re following these best practices: \n\n* you're using an industry-standard algorithm such as AES, \n* you’re using the recommended key size, \n* you’re managing your cryptographic keys properly by not storing your key in the same place and changing it regularly, \n* the key-generating algorithms used to obtain the new key each time are random enough. \n\nFor the examples of data given above, you can have the following encryption schemes: \n\n* full disk encryption, \n* database encryption, \n* file system encryption, \n* cloud assets encryption. \n\nOne important aspect of encryption is cryptographic keys management. You must store your keys safely to ensure confidentiality of your data. \n\nYou can store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM), which are dedicated hardware devices for key management. They are hardened against malware or other types of attacks. \n\nAnother secure solution is storing keys in the cloud, using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\n**What is at rest data vulnerable to?** \n\nAlthough data at rest is the easiest to secure out of all three states, it is usually the point of focus for attackers. There are a few types of attacks data in transit is vulnerable to: \n\n* **Exfiltration attacks.** The most common way at rest data is compromised is through exfiltration attacks, which means that hackers try to steal that data. For this reason, implementing a very robust encryption scheme is important.  <br>Another essential thing to note is that, when data is exfiltrated, even if it is encrypted, attackers can try to brute-force cryptographic keys offline for a long period of time. Therefore a long, random encryption key should be used (and rotated regularly). \n* **Hardware attacks.** If a person loses their laptop, phone, or USB drive and the data stored on them is not encrypted (and the devices are not protected by passwords or have weak passwords), the individual who found the device can read its contents. \n\n## Are you protecting data in all states? \n\nUse Cyscale to ensure that you’re protecting data by taking advantage of over 400 controls. \n\nHere are just a few examples of controls that ensure data security through encryption across different cloud vendors: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure server-side encryption is set to 'Encrypt with Service Key'* for Alibaba \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Crafting an Effective Cloud Security Strategy: Best Practices, Tutorials, and More","seoTitle":"Crafting an Effective Cloud Security Strategy: Best Practices & Tutorials ","description":"Explore the essentials of a robust cloud security strategy, blending best practices with hands-on tutorials.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given best practices. \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your cloud infrastructure is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in cloud security and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with the challenges of securing cloud resources.

As cloud services and cloud computing advance, the importance of cloud compliance becomes increasingly crucial. Dive into this guide as we explore the foundations and best practices of [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/). \n\n## The Basics of Cloud Compliance \n\n### What is Cloud Compliance? \n\nCloud compliance refers to the standards and laws set by regulation bodies to ensure data stored on the cloud remains safe, private, and within the boundaries of set cybersecurity rules. These rules often pertain to industries handling sensitive data, like healthcare (with HIPAA requirements) or e-commerce (following PCI DSS guidelines). \n\n### Key Regulations and Standards \n\n* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: This standard is focused around safeguarding credit card transactions. It regulates how cardholder data is stored and transmitted. \n* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: HIPAA is a United States healthcare law that refers to patient data and how it should be stored and used by companies. Moreover, this law covers how companies should act if patient PII is leaked. \n* **SOC 2**: Evaluates a company's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. \n* **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: Provides standards and guidelines for federal agencies to architect and secure their information systems. There are three frameworks that can be used when establishing compliance with the [NIST standard](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/): NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53, and NIST 800-171. \n* **ISO 27001**: This standard ensures that the organization has an effective and secure information security management. \n* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: GDPR is the most well-known and important European regulation protecting personal data. \n\n## Shared Responsibility Model \n\nThe shared responsibility model is a concept that defines how security responsibilities are divided between the cloud service provider (CSP), and the cloud user. This model outlines which party is responsible of each component of a cloud environment. For example, the cloud service provider is responsible of the physical security of the cloud computing infrastructure, while the customer takes care of their apps, data, and workloads. \n\nThe most popular cloud service providers are: \n\n1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\n2. Google Cloud \n\n3. Microsoft Azure \n\nAll major providers have, and regularly renew, their certificates of compliance with regulations. However, the weight of these regular updates also falls on the users’ shoulders: they still have the responsibility of getting certified to prove that the way they make use of cloud services (for apps, data, and workloads) matches the standard requirement. \n\n## Best Practices for Cloud Compliance \n\n### 1. Regular Audits \n\nRoutine checks are critical to identify potential vulnerabilities. Utilize tools like [cloud misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) to improve your cloud's security posture. \n\n### 2. Automation in Compliance \n\nBy integrating automation in compliance processes, you can help your company streamline future audits and achieve compliance easier. The Cyscale Cloud Platform removes a lot of the manual work that’s usually involved in preparing for and gathering evidence for an audit, offering support for popular standards such as [PCI DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/) or [ISO27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/). \n\n### 3. Education and Training \n\nThe realm of cloud security and compliance is ever-evolving. Continuous learning ensures your organization adheres to best practices, especially concerning cybersecurity. Moreover, conducting training for all employees of your company to help them understand how current prevalent attacks such as phishing work and how to protect themselves from them is a necessary step to protecting your organization. \n\n### 4. Data Management and Security \n\nGuard your sensitive data, with special attention for multi-cloud environments. While data security is vital in any computing environment, multi-cloud environments introduce additional complexities that require a heightened level of vigilance. Embrace encryption, multi-factor authentication, and API-level security. \n\n## Navigating Challenges \n\n### 1. Common Challenges in Cloud Compliance\n\nTo be able to address challenges in cloud compliance, you need to understand what some of the most common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are: \n\n* Poor access control, \n* Insufficient logging and monitoring, \n* Lack of encryption or the use of inadequate cryptographic algorithms, \n* Weak authentication, and others. \n\n### 2. Case Studies \n\nDive into scenarios where businesses faced cloud security challenges and understand the strategies they employed. Two examples of situations Cyscale has been helping companies with are: \n\n* [Lack of contextual visibility](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/) in a complex cloud environment \n* [A time-consuming compliance process](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech/) \n\n## How can Cyscale help? \n\nOffering unparalleled contextual visibility across cloud and data repositories, Cyscale grants organizations the power to scrutinize everything from resource-level configurations to their holistic compliance posture.

The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.
