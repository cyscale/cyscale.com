Entities that do not have the decryption key in their possession cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, read its content. \n\n## How does encryption work? \n\nPlaintext data is transformed, using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, to ciphertext, which is unreadable text.  \n\nThere are two types of encryption algorithms: \n\n* Symmetric,  \n* Asymmetric. \n\nIn symmetric algorithms, the key used to perform the encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt it and is, therefore, secret. \n\nExamples of symmetric algorithms are: \n\n* DES (Data Encryption Standard),  \n* 3DES (Triple DES), \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). \n\nThe latter one is, in 2022, the industry standard and is recommended to be used with 128 bits keys. \n\n![Symmetric encryption](/img/blog_17-cisco_encryption.png#shadow \"Symmetric encryption\")\n\nImage source – cisco.com \n\nAsymmetric algorithms use two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. \n\nAsymmetric algorithm examples are: \n\n* RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), \n* ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). \n\nAsymmetric algorithms are not commonly used for encryption because they are slower. For example, the RSA algorithm requires keys between 1024 and 4096 bits, which slows down the encryption and decryption process.  \n\nThese algorithms can be used, however, to encrypt symmetric algorithm keys when they are distributed. \n\nA more common usage of asymmetric algorithms is digital signatures. They are mathematical algorithms that are used to cryptographically validate the authenticity and integrity of a message or media on the internet. \n\n## What is encryption used for? \n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality of data. The unreadable ciphertext keeps the data private from all parties that do not possess the decryption key. \n\nData has three states: \n\n* In motion, \n* In use, \n* At rest. \n\nIt is essential to understand these states and ensure that the data is always encrypted. It is not enough to encrypt data only when it is stored if, when in transit, a malicious party can still read it.  \n\nTherefore, we will look at encryption mechanisms for all three data states. \n\n### In Motion Encryption \n\nData in motion, or in transit, is data that is moved from one location to another, for example, between: \n\n* computers,  \n* services,  \n* virtual machines,  \n* applications, \n* networks.  \n\nExamples of data in motion are: \n\n* emails, \n* files, \n* messages. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nSSL/TLS ensure confidentiality through encryption. Firstly, a session is created between the two parties exchanging a message using asymmetric encryption. Then, after the secure session is established, symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt the data in motion. \n\nUsing one of the mentioned protocols prevents attackers from reading the data in motion. \n\nWebsites should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP to ensure encryption between websites and browsers. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS. \n\n**What is in motion data vulnerable to?** \n\n**Eavesdropping attacks.** In this situation, malicious entities can analyze traffic sent over the internet and read unencrypted data.   \n\n### In Use Encryption \n\nData currently accessed and used is considered in use.   \n\nExamples of in use data are: \n\n* files that are currently open, \n* databases, \n* RAM data. \n\nBecause data needs to be decrypted to become in use, it is essential that data security is taken care of before the actual use of data begins. \n\nTo do this, you need to ensure a good authentication mechanism. Technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be implemented to increase security. \n\nMoreover, after a user authenticates, access management is necessary. Users should not be allowed to access any available resources, only the ones they need to, in order to perform their job.  \n\nA method of encryption for data in use is Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory using an AES-128 encryption engine and an [AMD EPYC processor](https://developer.amd.com/sev/). Other hardware vendors are also offering memory encryption for data in use, but this area is still relatively new. \n\n**What is in use data vulnerable to?**  \n\nIn use data is vulnerable to **authentication attacks**. These types of attacks are used to gain access to the data by bypassing authentication, brute-forcing or obtaining credentials, and others. \n\nAnother type of attack for data in use is a **cold boot attack**. Even though the RAM memory is considered volatile, after a computer is turned off, it takes a few minutes for that memory to be erased. If kept at low temperatures, RAM memory can be extracted, and, therefore, the last data loaded in the RAM memory can be read. \n\n### At Rest Encryption \n\nOnce data arrives at the destination and is not used, it becomes at rest.  \n\nExamples of data at rest are: \n\n* databases, \n* cloud storage assets such as buckets, \n* files and file archives, \n* USB drives, and others. \n\nThis data state is usually most targeted by attackers who attempt to read databases, steal files stored on the computer, obtain USB drives, and others. \n\nEncryption of data at rest is fairly simple and is usually done using symmetric algorithms. When you perform at rest data encryption, you need to ensure you’re following these best practices: \n\n* you're using an industry-standard algorithm such as AES, \n* you’re using the recommended key size, \n* you’re managing your cryptographic keys properly by not storing your key in the same place and changing it regularly, \n* the key-generating algorithms used to obtain the new key each time are random enough. \n\nFor the examples of data given above, you can have the following encryption schemes: \n\n* full disk encryption, \n* database encryption, \n* file system encryption, \n* cloud assets encryption. \n\nOne important aspect of encryption is cryptographic keys management. You must store your keys safely to ensure confidentiality of your data. \n\nYou can store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM), which are dedicated hardware devices for key management. They are hardened against malware or other types of attacks. \n\nAnother secure solution is storing keys in the cloud, using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in GCP. \n\n**What is at rest data vulnerable to?** \n\nAlthough data at rest is the easiest to secure out of all three states, it is usually the point of focus for attackers. There are a few types of attacks data in transit is vulnerable to: \n\n* **Exfiltration attacks.** The most common way at rest data is compromised is through exfiltration attacks, which means that hackers try to steal that data. For this reason, implementing a very robust encryption scheme is important.  <br>Another essential thing to note is that, when data is exfiltrated, even if it is encrypted, attackers can try to brute-force cryptographic keys offline for a long period of time. Therefore a long, random encryption key should be used (and rotated regularly). \n* **Hardware attacks.** If a person loses their laptop, phone, or USB drive and the data stored on them is not encrypted (and the devices are not protected by passwords or have weak passwords), the individual who found the device can read its contents. \n\n## Are you protecting data in all states? \n\nUse Cyscale to ensure that you’re protecting data by taking advantage of over 400 controls. \n\nHere are just a few examples of controls that ensure data security through encryption across different cloud vendors: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for GCP \n* *Ensure server-side encryption is set to 'Encrypt with Service Key'* for Alibaba \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1.
