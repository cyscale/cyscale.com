Something had to be done, and fast!\n\nThe Cybersecurity market responded with innovation, and so a new security category was born: the _Cloud Infrastructure Security Posture Assessment._\n\nThe main objective of tools in this category was to report configuration errors discovered in the rapidly changing environment that is the cloud.\n\nAs the products quickly evolved and gained in complexity, the initial name was changed to **_CSPM_** - or **_Cloud Security Posture Management_**, but the main purpose of the solutions remained the same: to monitor the cloud infrastructure, [identify potential misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and help with security policy enforcement.\n\nIncluded in Gartner's “Top 10 Security Projects for 2019”, the CSPM represents one of the most important technologies that leaders should invest in when using cloud or multi-cloud infrastructures.\n\n<el name=\"when-cspm\">\n\n### **When to choose a CSPM and when not to**\n\n</el>\n\nA Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the **unintentional risks** that can expose your data.\n\nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility. Regardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches and possibly data leakage.\n\n<el name=\"missconfigurations\">\n\n#### **_Misconfigurations - cause and effect_**\n\n</el>\n\nWe've all heard about major breaches that happened because of AWS S3 buckets being publicly accessible. (This exact [misconfiguration happened to Romania's largest real estate portal](https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach/ 'https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach') ).\n\nMany cloud application creators or maintainers don't believe this can happen to them, but, for example, when new virtual machines are launched in a hurry by a less experienced DevOps engineer, mistakes can occur and networks that should have been private are now public and exposed.\n\nOther common misconfigurations that attackers are often exploiting are overprivileged credentials. Restricting users' access to data and resources to only what is strictly required for them to do their jobs is a must, in other words, you need to use the **least privilege principle**.\n\nThe [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) will report and advise against using overly permissive account settings for your users, and at the same time remind you to use encryption, thus strengthening your security and making it even harder for an unauthorized or malicious individual to access and expose your data.\n\nThe advanced CSPM solutions we see these days offer continuous monitoring, risk assessments, remediation recommendations based on security best practices, and assistance for compliance with the most common security frameworks and standards.\n\nWhat if you could have a powerful solution that offers full visibility over your cloud accounts, enabling better communication and collaboration between your Security team, the DevOps, and the Compliance team?\n\nThis solution exists! You need to implement a CSPM to improve your cloud security posture and to build a strong Security Program.\n\nUnlike other security software which takes a lot of time to set up, requiring multiple steps to achieve proper installation and configuration, a CSPM platform is agentless. To have it up and running takes only minutes and best of all, it has no negative impact in your infrastructure's performance.\n\nThe scan of your cloud account infrastructure will start immediately after onboarding and the results, meaning the identified issues and security risks will be displayed, usually ranked by severity or risk score.\n\n<el name=\"extra-visibility\">\n\n### **_Take advantage of the extra visibility_**\n\n</el>\n\nA CSPM will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure, making it easy to prioritize the order and urgency of solving these issues.\n\nYour cloud infrastructure is not a one-way road, cloud assets are interconnected, and it is critical to understand how this can lead to exposed resources.\n\nThe complete cloud assets inventory will automatically be compared against a set of best practices.\n\nHaving full visibility is key when implementing security best practices.\n\nManaging your cloud assets from a single dashboard is an important and useful feature.\n\nYour Security team is responsible for monitoring the cloud against threats, possible attacks, or malicious behavior. Your DevOps team is rapidly building and deploying applications in the cloud (and therefore adding new cloud assets), while your Compliance and Auditing team needs to make sure the company and its cloud infrastructure stay compliant with regulations and standards. What a dedicated solution such as a CSPM does for you, is to make sure that the relevant information is available to each of these teams in an easily comprehensible manner.\n\n<el name=\"better-security\">\n\n### **_Better security for your cloud environments with the CSPM_** **_solution_**\n\n</el>\n\nSome cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform have security recommendations in place, however, you need to understand that they apply only to that specific cloud provider and in many cases, they turn out to be false positives, since the context is not taken into consideration.\n\nNot to mention that a multi-cloud strategy will complicate security efforts since IT security teams must deal with the fact that configuration is different from one cloud provider to the other.\n\nCSPM solutions do not require the deployment of any additional resources to enforce cloud security best practices and will identify and help mitigate these security risks across cloud providers.\n\nAccording to Gartner, CSPM tools can identify risks in the configurations of your cloud infrastructure and will immediately react either with automatic remediations or with specific instructions on how to fix the misconfiguration and eliminate risks.\n\nThere are other types of tools that handle sensitive workloads and data in the cloud or that monitor user activity. All these tools are enforcing security policies and together they can ensure the proper protection in the cloud.\n\nSolutions such as Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) can have similar features with a CSPM.\n\nCASB software, for example, was created to monitor and enforce enterprise security, and it is not necessarily cloud-based. It can be installed on-premise, placed between cloud applications and their users acting as a central gateway that controls users' access to the cloud. It includes DLP (Data Loss Prevention) capabilities, Governance, Data encryption, MDM (Mobile Device Management).\n\nCWPP comprises agent-based solutions that offer visibility and security management for workloads. So, the provided inventory mainly covers VMs (Virtual Machines), public cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service), and container-based application architectures. A CWPP solution does not provide event monitoring outside workloads.\n\nEven if CASB, CWPP, and CSPM may sound similar at first, their scope and coverage are different, as they represent different categories. You will need to decide which tool or tools are the right ones for your organization.\n\n<el name=\"compliance\">\n\n### **_Compliance controls across your environment in the cloud_**\n\n</el>\n\nCompanies that closely follow regulatory compliance are using Cloud Security Posture Management tools to avoid breaches that usually ruin the brand reputation and bring monetary fines to the company.\n\nA CSPM solution can offer predefined Policies needed for compliance with the most common benchmarks and regulations such as CIS, NIST, HIPPA, ISO27001, or others.\n\nConsidering the compliance aspect, you could be tempted to believe that a CSPM solution is just another GRC tool (Governance Risk and Compliance), but in reality, it is more than that.\n\nUsing CSPM software, you can get a grip on your cloud compliance strategy in just a couple of steps:\n\n#### **Start by identifying the applicable standards for your company.**\n\nUsually, you will find a specific section in the platform where the most common standards and regulations are defined and implemented from a cloud security perspective. PCI-DSS, NIST, GDPR, CIS, ISO, HIPPA - are just some examples of what you can expect to find.\n\n#### **Next, you will determine the requirements and start documenting your compliance processes.**\n\nPredefined compliance policies are offered, but you will be able to define custom ones, specific to your needs. Policies have technical controls attached that are automatically assessed. In case of a failed assessment, remediation actions are suggested.\n\nA CSPM solution can be a powerful reporting and evidence collection tool, making it easy to always be prepared for audits and inspections.\n\nWhen it comes to defining Policies and Procedures for the governance of your organization — for example, Access Management Policy, Change Management Policy, and so on — Cyscale's solution offers these out-of-the-box and you can use them as baselines, customizable to your needs.\n\n#### **The last but very important step is to monitor changes and configuration drifts.**\n\nThis is when the ongoing monitoring capability of the CSPM software comes in handy. Once you define your set of policies, the solution will help identify compliance drifts.\n\nYour Compliance Officers can use the CSPM as an in-house audit tool, assisting them in preparing for externally conducted or formal compliance audits.\n\nA CSPM tool will help you handle compliance concerns, minimize threats, catch errors and empower you to align IT security strategy across the company.\n\nWhen you are looking for a CSPM solution, keep in mind that visibility and context go hand in hand and that Cyscale Cloud Platform can offer the most comprehensive context thanks to its unique Security Knowledge Graph™.\n\nAs Gartner stated: “the use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. So, although, there are cases when a CSPM solution's functionalities can overlap with those of other security tools, it could never be fully replaced by any of them.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n_Photo by [Hal Gatewood](https://unsplash.com/@halacious?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)_\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!
