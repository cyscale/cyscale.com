Something had to be done, and fast!\n\nThe Cybersecurity market responded with innovation, and so a new security category was born: the *Cloud Infrastructure Security Posture Assessment.*\n\nThe main objective of tools in this category was to report configuration errors discovered in the rapidly changing environment that is the cloud.\n\nAs the products quickly evolved and gained in complexity, the initial name was changed to [***CSPM*** - or ***Cloud Security Posture Management***](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), but the main purpose of the solutions remained the same: to monitor the cloud infrastructure, [identify potential misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and help with security policy enforcement.\n\nIn this age of rapid technological advances, it's crucial to recognize the ever-evolving [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/). With the digital landscape shifting constantly, businesses face new threats and vulnerabilities. It's against this backdrop that the importance and necessity of solutions like CSPM become even more evident.\n\nIncluded in Gartner's “Top 10 Security Projects for 2019”, the CSPM represents one of the most important technologies that leaders should invest in when using cloud or multi-cloud infrastructures.\n\n## When to choose a CSPM and when not to\n\nA Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the **unintentional risks** that can expose your data.\n\nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility. Regardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches and possibly data leakage.\n\n### Misconfigurations - cause and effect\n\nWe've all heard about major breaches that happened because of AWS S3 buckets being publicly accessible. (This exact [misconfiguration happened to Romania's largest real estate portal](https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach\") ).\n\nMany cloud application creators or maintainers don't believe this can happen to them, but, for example, when new virtual machines are launched in a hurry by a less experienced DevOps engineer, mistakes can occur and networks that should have been private are now public and exposed.\n\nOther common misconfigurations that attackers are often exploiting are overprivileged credentials. Restricting users' access to data and resources to only what is strictly required for them to do their jobs is a must, in other words, you need to use the **least privilege principle**.\n\nThe [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) will report and advise against using overly permissive account settings for your users, and at the same time remind you to use encryption, thus strengthening your security and making it even harder for an unauthorized or malicious individual to access and expose your data.\n\nThe advanced CSPM solutions we see these days offer continuous monitoring, risk assessments, remediation recommendations based on security best practices, and assistance for compliance with the most common security frameworks and standards.\n\nWhat if you could have a powerful solution that offers full visibility over your cloud accounts, enabling better communication and collaboration between your Security team, the DevOps, and the Compliance team?\n\nThis solution exists! You need to implement a CSPM to improve your cloud security posture and to build a strong Security Program.\n\nUnlike other security software which takes a lot of time to set up, requiring multiple steps to achieve proper installation and configuration, a CSPM platform is agentless. To have it up and running takes only minutes and best of all, it has no negative impact in your infrastructure's performance.\n\nThe scan of your cloud account infrastructure will start immediately after onboarding and the results, meaning the identified issues and security risks will be displayed, usually ranked by severity or risk score.\n\n## Take advantage of the extra visibility\n\nA CSPM will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure, making it easy to prioritize the order and urgency of solving these issues.\n\nYour cloud infrastructure is not a one-way road, cloud assets are interconnected, and it is critical to understand how this can lead to exposed resources.\n\nThe complete cloud assets inventory will automatically be compared against a set of best practices.\n\nHaving full visibility is key when implementing security best practices.\n\nManaging your cloud assets from a single dashboard is an important and useful feature.\n\nYour Security team is responsible for monitoring the cloud against threats, possible attacks, or malicious behavior. Your DevOps team is rapidly building and deploying applications in the cloud (and therefore adding new cloud assets), while your Compliance and Auditing team needs to make sure the company and its cloud infrastructure stay compliant with regulations and standards. What a dedicated solution such as a CSPM does for you, is to make sure that the relevant information is available to each of these teams in an easily comprehensible manner.\n\n## Better security for your cloud environments with the CSPM solution\n\nSome cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform have security recommendations in place, however, you need to understand that they apply only to that specific cloud provider and in many cases, they turn out to be false positives, since the context is not taken into consideration.\n\nNot to mention that a multi-cloud strategy will complicate security efforts since IT security teams must deal with the fact that configuration is different from one cloud provider to the other.\n\nCSPM solutions do not require the deployment of any additional resources to enforce cloud security best practices and will identify and help mitigate these security risks across cloud providers.\n\nAccording to Gartner, CSPM tools can identify risks in the configurations of your [cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) and will immediately react either with automatic remediations or with specific instructions on how to fix the misconfiguration and eliminate risks.\n\nThere are other types of tools that handle sensitive workloads and data in the cloud or that monitor user activity. All these tools are enforcing security policies and together they can ensure the proper protection in the cloud.\n\nSolutions such as Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) can have similar features with a CSPM.\n\nCASB software, for example, was created to monitor and enforce enterprise security, and it is not necessarily cloud-based. It can be installed on-premise, placed between cloud applications and their users acting as a central gateway that controls users' access to the cloud. It includes DLP (Data Loss Prevention) capabilities, Governance, Data encryption, MDM (Mobile Device Management).\n\nCWPP comprises agent-based solutions that offer visibility and security management for workloads. So, the provided inventory mainly covers VMs (Virtual Machines), public cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service), and container-based application architectures. A CWPP solution does not provide event monitoring outside workloads.\n\nEven if CASB, CWPP, and CSPM may sound similar at first, their scope and coverage are different, as they represent different categories. You will need to decide which tool or tools are the right ones for your organization.\n\n## Compliance controls across your environment in the cloud\n\nCompanies that closely follow regulatory compliance are using Cloud Security Posture Management tools to avoid breaches that usually ruin the brand reputation and bring monetary fines to the company.\n\nA CSPM solution can offer predefined Policies needed for compliance with the most common benchmarks and regulations such as CIS, NIST, HIPPA, ISO27001, or others.\n\nConsidering the compliance aspect, you could be tempted to believe that a CSPM solution is just another GRC tool (Governance Risk and Compliance), but in reality, it is more than that.\n\nUsing CSPM software, you can get a grip on your cloud compliance strategy in just a couple of steps:\n\n**Start by identifying the applicable standards for your company.**\n\nUsually, you will find a specific section in the platform where the most common standards and regulations are defined and implemented from a cloud security perspective. PCI-DSS, NIST, GDPR, CIS, ISO, HIPPA - are just some examples of what you can expect to find.\n\n**Next, you will determine the requirements and start documenting your compliance processes.**\n\nPredefined compliance policies are offered, but you will be able to define custom ones, specific to your needs. Policies have technical controls attached that are automatically assessed. In case of a failed assessment, remediation actions are suggested.\n\nA CSPM solution can be a powerful reporting and evidence collection tool, making it easy to always be prepared for audits and inspections.\n\nWhen it comes to defining Policies and Procedures for the governance of your organization — for example, Access Management Policy, Change Management Policy, and so on — Cyscale's solution offers these out-of-the-box and you can use them as baselines, customizable to your needs.\n\n**The last but very important step is to monitor changes and configuration drifts.**\n\nThis is when the ongoing monitoring capability of the CSPM software comes in handy. Once you define your set of policies, the solution will help identify compliance drifts.\n\nYour Compliance Officers can use the CSPM as an in-house audit tool, assisting them in preparing for externally conducted or formal compliance audits.\n\nA CSPM tool will help you handle compliance concerns, minimize threats, catch errors and empower you to align [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) across the company.\n\nWhen you are looking for a CSPM solution, keep in mind that visibility and context go hand in hand and that Cyscale Cloud Platform can offer the most comprehensive context thanks to its unique Security Knowledge Graph™.\n\nAs Gartner stated: “the use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. So, although, there are cases when a CSPM solution's functionalities can overlap with those of other security tools, it could never be fully replaced by any of them.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*Photo by [Hal Gatewood](https://unsplash.com/@halacious?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: Compromising Azure Cloud as a Guest","description":"Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the first line of defense against attackers in the cloud.

In the realm of cloud security, IAM represents all of the measures and good practices implemented to prevent intruders from accessing cloud resources. \n\nAn organization's cloud environment may be in danger if authentication and authorization are not handled correctly. \n\nIAM, coupled with contextual security, is the recipe for success. Understanding the level of access for each user – as well as how that access impacts other assets – is vital. It may not seem like much if a user has read permissions over a storage account, but if that storage account contains sensitive data, such as credentials for another account, then the magnitude of the impact will surpass your initial assessment. \n\nIn this article, I will show you how human mistakes can lead to a complex attack path, where a malicious user gains access to a storage account, compromises a user, and ultimately gains access to a key vault that contains cryptographic keys and secrets used by the company’s apps. \n\nI’ve chosen a scenario where gross mistakes are made to highlight that you should not underestimate human error and the blast radius it can have.  \n\n## Case Study\n\nFintech Inc. is a financial technology startup developing a new banking application. A few customers already use the new app to access their banking data in real-time and manage their accounts. Fintech Inc. uses Microsoft Azure to develop and host their app. \n\nThe company must invite an external consultant, Anita, to collaborate in the cloud. Any user is allowed by default to invite guests in Microsoft Entra ID (former Azure Active Directory), so John, a member of the IT department, invites Anita as a guest. \n\nHowever, he makes a mistake; because he’s trying to accomplish many things in a short period of time, instead of inviting anita@fintechinc.com, he invites anita@fintech.com. The new guest user accepts the invitation and becomes a guest in Microsoft Entra ID. \n\nAs a guest, the \"fake\" Anita cannot do much. She can only access some resources that guests can access, she can manage her profile and collaborate with other users in Office 365 apps.  \n\nBut, looking closely, she discovers that she is now part of the ITAdmins group. How did that happen?! On a closer look, ITAdmins has a dynamic membership rule that states that all users whose department is \"IT\" become part of the group. The IT department wanted to make things easy for them and allow all employees in IT to join this group automatically. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-dynamic-membership-rule.png\" alt=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" title=\"Dynamic membership rule for ITAdmins group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, this rule is very broad and opens up the possibility for mistakes. In this case, Anita was assigned the “IT” department, and she immediately joined the ITAdmins group, since Azure checks the attributes for a user whenever they are changed or a new user joins the cloud.  \n\nUpon further investigation, Anita discovers that the ITAdmins group has a very highly privileged role over the “rg-management\" resource group – the Contributor role. This role allows Anita to view, modify, and delete any resources within the resource group. Here comes the importance of the Least Privilege Principle – granting users too many permissions can do more harm than good. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-it-admins-contributor-rg-management.png\" alt=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" title=\"ITAdmins is Contributor over the rg-management resource group\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we take a look at this resource group, we will see it contains an interesting storage account – “backups”, a database, and a VM. \n\nWe can see this relation in the graph below. Tracing the attack path, we immediately realize how Anita is able to access the cloud assets, from the rg-management resource group through the new role she gained by joining ITAdmins, and therefore compromise them. By looking at context in the cloud, we become aware of the risk imposed by the ITAdmins groups, which has broad permissions over a multitude of important resources. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-first-graph.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the attack path\" title=\"Graph showing the attack path\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe storage account has a \"backups\" container with a \"diskBackup.vhd\" file inside. This contains the files and data an ex-employee used before leaving the company. While in a rush, an IT admin has decided to back up the disk and look at it at some other time, later forgetting about it. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-backups-container.png\" alt=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" title=\"The contents of the 'backups' container\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUpon restoring this file as a computer disk, Anita discovers a set of credentials. She knows she should not log in using those credentials, but she does it anyway – after all, this is not the first questionable action she’s done -, because she is curious.  \n\nThe set of credentials – an email and a password – are for a test user that was created in the past to test features of the application, the removal of which was forgotten. The user cannot log in to the portal due to a Conditional Access policy that denies access to the Microsoft Azure Management resource (Portal included).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-access-to-portal-denied.png\" alt=\"Portal access denied for user\" title=\"Portal access denied for user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nFortunately, Anita can still log in using the credentials – through the CLI. This is a common \"bypass\" of this barrier, and, fortunately, she's good with command lines, so she can investigate what permissions her new user has. \n\nShe checks her new role assignments in the current subscription using the commandlet *Get-AzRoleAssignment* only to find, among other roles, that she’s a Key Vault Administrator. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-key-vault-administrator-role.png\" alt=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" title=\"The new user has the Key Vault Administrator role\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the Key Vault Administrator role, Anita can [perform all data plane operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) on the Credentials2 key vault that we can see in the image above, and all objects in it. \n\nA key vault is a huge discovery for Anita, who can investigate further. Using the commandlet *Get-AzKeyVaultSecret*, Anita can see that there are a few keys and secrets in the key vault. She can now read them, delete them or add new versions of those secrets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-contents-of-the-key-vault.png\" alt=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" title=\"The contents of the Credentials2 Key Vault\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/55_blog-second-graph.png\" alt=\"The attack path for the new user\" title=\"The attack path for the new user\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nAnita can now further discover other assets available on Fintech Inc.’s Azure cloud environment and possibly make use of the secrets stored in the “Credentials2” Key Vault. For example, we know that, as a best practice, [databases are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/), so a leaked decryption cryptographic key, for example, can lead to total compromise of the company’s data. \n\nTo understand everything that happened here, we need to look at all the bad practices and vulnerabilities that we have uncovered, in chronological order: \n\n1. Due to being in a rush, an employee invited the wrong person to collaborate in Azure, and no one picked up on it. \n2. The dynamic membership rule for the ITAdmins group is very broad and may accept unintended cases. \n3. The ITAdmins group has a highly privileged role over a resource group with many resources that may contain sensitive information, such as databases, and storage accounts. \n4. A disk backup that can be restored is held unencrypted in a storage account, containing a cleartext password for an active Azure account. \n5. A test user that was intended to be temporary is still active. \n6. A test user has access to a very high-value resource. \n\nAs you can see, each mistake allowed the intruder to advance more and more and compromise additional resources. \n\nThis is why contextual security and proper IAM security are necessary. Contextual security allows cloud professionals to understand what assets are impacted by others, while IAM best practices protect the cloud environment from intruders and represent the first barrier of entry.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Product"],"title":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups    ","seoTitle":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups | Cyscale ","description":"This essential guide for startups looks at the pros and cons of enterprise-grade, free, and cloud providers' own security solutions.

From your intellectual property and software services you sell, to sensitive data on customers and users, any threat can put your reputation on the line.  \n\nWhile public cloud resources are key enablers of business, they come with the adoption of a shared responsibility model that makes it difficult to define your security perimeter. This makes securing your apps and data in the cloud a complex and confusing process. But it doesn’t have to be. Good cloud security is achievable for any business, regardless of size, and it shouldn’t take all your time and resources to get it right.  \n\n### Context is king \n\nHow many cloud resources or assets am I running? What even is a cloud resource? My engineers are creating new assets every week, how am I going to keep track of them all? Where does the responsibility of AWS end and mine begin? These are the kind of questions you are going to be faced with, whether cloud security is your full-time job or just part of your responsibility for the overall tech stack.  \n\nFinding answers to these questions and more, will take time and effort because there are no standard responses. Everyone’s cloud infrastructure is different and brings with it unique risks.  \n\nThis is why context is so important. Cybersecurity tools are notorious for creating alert fatigue – an overwhelming number of alerts for every vulnerability, misconfiguration, and new threat out there. Following up on all these alerts as and when they come in, can easily start out as a fool’s errand and frequently become humanly impossible.  \n\nFor example: An unsecured Virtual Machine in isolation may pose no risk but will still trigger an alert. An unsecured VM that has access to a bucket used to store sensitive client data poses a much bigger risk that your company, your customers, and your lawyers will care about.  \n\n**Identify** \n\nBeing able to identify the risks is only one part of the challenge.   \n\n**Prioritize** \n\nUnderstanding the context of the risk to prioritize it is an essential second stage in the process. \n\n**Fix** \n\nThe steps needed to remediate the risk are the third stage in the solution. \n\nBecause there is no one-size-fits-all solution to cloud infrastructure security, any attempt to follow this path will eventually result in frustration due to not feeling in control, and a lack of understanding of the impact of a security issue, which can lead to bigger threats.  \n\n### My cloud provider has its own security tools, can’t I just use them? \n\nAll the big cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer a suite of security tools specific to their products and these are a common choice for cloud native organizations as they can be added on when buying cloud services and are built by the same provider.  \n\nBut these solutions have evolved in line with the sprawling menu of cloud services on offer, and the application of these tools has become granular to the level where some security components and their corresponding configuration are attached to specific products and services, and then again to specific regions and resources.  \n\nThe cloud providers charge for security services in much the same way they do for cloud resources. Not only does this frequently trigger the ‘bill shock’ associated with cloud consumption, because activating a native security solution for a service introduces unpredictability into the pricing, it makes management of your cloud security posture very complex and time consuming.  \n\nThis approach has significant implications for context as well – because information is scattered within the toolset, you are required to make the relevant correlations yourself, resulting in poor overall visibility and blind spots.  \n\nFurthermore, this is just for a single cloud environment. If your organization needs to secure apps or data across multiple clouds, you need to learn a whole other set of security services and tools specific to the cloud environment.  \n\nSo, if you use the AWS supplied toolset, you must go to 1,000 different places to understand all your security settings, let alone how all the security settings relate and connect to one another. And when you go to Azure, it's another 1,000 places that you go to check. \n\nOf course, some companies will become proficient in using the cloud provider’s own security tools, but there is still the associated cost in deployment and the investment into a non-transferrable skill. This can result in cloud security know-how being concentrated within certain people and makes it difficult to understand your broader posture from both a cloud security and compliance perspective.  \n\n### What about the big-name cloud security solutions I read about in a Gartner report? \n\nThere are well-established vendors, like Check Point, that have developed their portfolios over time, and there are relative newcomers to cloud security, like Orca and Wiz, that have picked up big name customers and you would be wise to assess these offerings.  \n\nHowever, most of these solutions are targeted at enterprise customers with big teams and big budgets, and even the analysts note that some of the most comprehensive security solutions are not suitable for smaller organizations due to the investment required in skills, deployment, and management, not to mention the overall cost.  \n\nFor even the most experienced of users, heavyweight solutions can become overwhelming, resulting in a counter-effective approach as users lose control of their security posture.  \n\n### But there are free tools I can use \n\nThe cloud security landscape is very competitive and there are a range of tools available that claim to be completely free. But anyone making security tools for cloud infrastructure knows that cybersecurity is not something you can cut costs on, so these tools will not remain free, except perhaps for the smallest organizations.  \n\nMost of the free tools are limited in scope or capability requiring a paid ‘upgrade’ to unlock. Others are designed to be self-installed at the free level – a challenge in itself – while the as-a-service version comes with a price tag.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for, and solutions that have no investment in their development are unlikely to offer the level of service and support you get from a paid solution. These tools will quickly become frustrating due to a shortfall in features and an overreliance on multiple offerings to achieve an inferior result.  \n\nCyscale itself offers a free trial of the full product with no limitations, as well as onboarding support to ensure you will get the most value out of our solution before you buy.  \n\n### How do I address cloud infrastructure compliance? \n\nEnabled by the agility of cloud computing, many companies launch SaaS products into the market without fully understanding the regulatory climate, then realize they need to show compliance.   \n\nWith an infrastructure that changes on a weekly or even daily basis as engineers spin up new VMs and resources, preparing for an audit can be stressful, especially in regulated environments where you have to check your security posture against frameworks such as CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST, or many others. \n\nFurther challenges can arise in organizations where engineers have adopted a cloud provider’s own security tools, as these products are notoriously difficult to get visibility into whether established policies are being followed in implementations, leaving you blind to security drifts.   \n\nAt the end of the day, compliance should be delivered as a byproduct of good security, and your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) approach should ensure you are able to see compliance with regulatory frameworks and policies without the need to manually correlate reports from multiple applications.  \n\n### Identity, Access, and Entitlements \n\nOne of the biggest challenges when building applications in the cloud is identity, access, and entitlements, sometimes referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM). This refers to all the best practices and rules that must be followed when establishing authentication and authorization for a user to an organization’s systems and applications, because while keeping track of who has access to what sounds simple, it’s something that is really difficult to do in the cloud. \n\nMoreover, access is not restricted to human users; applications and other types of identities also require access to different types of resources.  \n\nOf course, the big cloud providers each have their own unique approach to access management, and this means learning approaches specific to each cloud environment. Some cloud security solutions integrate with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and help you manage identities and access form a central location, improving your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\n### Understanding the cloud infrastructure security landscape \n\n**Glossary** \n\n[CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management) \n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions are designed specifically for cloud environments, using the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers to gather rich data on cloud configuration and workloads. Cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\n[Misconfiguration](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) \n\nAn incorrect configuration of a cloud system that may lead to vulnerabilities. Possible misconfigurations are too many to list but may include making sensitive databases publicly accessible, creating identities with access rights more elevated than required, enabling write access on a resource that should be read only.  \n\n[Vulnerability](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) \n\nA vulnerability is an inherent weakness in a cloud system that means a resource is unable to resist the actions of a threat agent. A vulnerability could be created through a misconfiguration, or series of misconfigurations, but it could also be a newly discovered flaw in a piece of code or software that a resource is dependent on.  \n\nThreat \n\nA cloud threat is a type of attack or adversary looking to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in data breaches, data loss, system hijacking, and a myriad of other internal and external threats.  \n\nResource \n\nA cloud resource, also known as an asset, refers to any one of a number of entities including but not limited to, a virtual machine, a database, or storage bucket. An asset could also refer to VPC, subnet, policy, security key, or IP address. \n\n[CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) \n\nA CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps. A cloud-native application is an application that is designed for, run and hosted in the cloud.  \n\nCIEM \n\nCIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) tools manage identities and access privileges to cloud infrastructure and services. It is often deployed as an umbrella solution that includes Identity and Access Management (IAM). \n\n**Download this guide as a PDF** \n\n<div class=\"hs-cta-embed hs-cta-simple-placeholder hs-cta-embed-136438852760\" style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;width:210px;height:42.390625px\" data-hubspot-wrapper-cta-id=\"136438852760\"><a href=\"https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKTGbp%2Fo9uY%2B1cpwqxYO%2BVdgBMG2bgcgDZpv3UP7fDM0cPci8FmFfQrFEsURZY%2FBCwYOLNlG1XYE6BnbA1HIeTHNfwLiP2GUGYlTRO8CW82qb9egx0YmY9aQqHwOJa6iekClG%2FMfqEbCu0Dp5wkLzxfl7v4ITdglHTHc9cfvbVS11AWnEbx0NEGVzaWJngIJAT7AL7Hb9Sj8j%2BtDc7O96NDo4C5OsZhIeDO7CXDRRccKrDRsTFtfE9f4VAPVJWvV65oHjHpAVfzD5qX8u%2BU%2FIVvOMducO6AS96ZUM4%3D&webInteractiveContentId=136438852760&portalId=5413427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><img alt=\"Download\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5413427/interactive-136438852760.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: fill\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"/></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","description":"The future of cloud security is contextual security.

And although companies were reluctant to put their infrastructure and applications in the hands of a different company, cloud solutions have grown in popularity.  \n\nWith more and more complex setups, it is hard for an organization to understand and keep track of the implication of every resource they have in the cloud, the risk it poses to the entire infrastructure or how many other assets it impacts. \n\nI believe the future of cloud security is contextual security. To fully understand how secure an asset is, you need to understand what users have permissions to interact with it and what resources it communicates with. It might seem that a VM is completely secure because you put it behind a firewall, but if a compromised user can access it, it’s game over. \n\nThe perfect recipe for contextual security is a [Cloud Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/). Based on it, we can represent in a visual and interactive way how cloud resources interact, what kind of relations they have, what users have permissions to read/write on them, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate my point, I will show you some scenarios where the difference between a secure cloud and a breach is made by fixing misconfigurations and limiting users' access. These measures are easier to identify using a graph, because it helps you understand the risks your environment is exposed to.  \n\n## Case Study \n\nLet’s assume we use BigQuery in Google Cloud for a health analytics application. We have a table that contains some datasets of patients from a hospital, including PII data. These datasets are very valuable and cannot fall in the hands of outsiders. \n\nNow, we want to make sure that the data is securely stored. We look at the BigQuery table’s graph to see if the table poses any risk and, low and behold, it does! \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-graf0.png\" alt=\"Contextual security through the graph\" title=\"Contextual security through the graph\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe can observe, in the image above, that no less than 7 Cloud Functions and 4 VMs can access it across 9 Service Accounts that have permissions on the BigQueryTable, as well as 7 IAM Users. Does this alarm you? It should. \n\nBut just because a VM, or a function, can have access to the table does not mean anything, right? Wrong! I’m going to show you exactly how bad things can get in this situation. I’m going to put my hacker shoes on and show you potential scenarios that might lead to data being stolen. \n\n### Scenario 1: compromised VM \n\nOut of the 4 VMs that we see in the image, one is an Internet-facing one. The compute instance “dev-1” hosts an application that has the Log4J vulnerability, a classic. A hacker leverages the vulnerability and gains access to the instance. If they take over an IAMUser with the Compute Instance Admin role, or obtain SSH access to the VM, the disaster begins. **Because a Service Account is associated to the VM, the attacker has that account’s permissions.** In our scenario, the application running on the Instance needs to process data in the dataset, so the associated Service Account was given the roles/bigquery.dataEditor permission. \n\nMoreover, in a VM, credentials used to manually authenticate are stored on the Compute Instance after the first time a user authenticates as a Service Account, in */.config/gcloud/credentials.db*, as you can see in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss1.png\" alt=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" title=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThis is a standard location and it stores the last private key that was used to authenticate as a Service Account.  You can also find access tokens in the same folder, in *access_tokens.db*. Moreover, you can see any other private keys used previously (which may still be valid, if they were not deleted in the Google Cloud Console) in */.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/<serviceAccountEmail>/adc.json*. \n\nLooking at the file credentials.db, we notice that the information is not stored in the standard format for a private key for a Service Account. With a few adjustments, we obtain a valid private key that we then use to authenticate. To authenticate as a Service Account with a private key, simply use the following command:  \n\n```\ngcloud auth activate-service-account <serviceAccountEmail> --key-file=<keyFile>\n```\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss2.png\" alt=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" title=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, what happens when no one has authenticated as a Service Account on the VM? There is no *credentials.db* file (actually, there is no *.config* folder).  \n\nDevelopers tend to find ways to do things faster, and they get comfortable. It is not uncommon to find secrets in environment variables or plain-text files. If a developer were to store a secret key file on the Compute Instance, we could abuse it. Simply log in using the private RSA key file: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss3.png\" alt=\"Private key on the VM\" title=\"Private key on the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss4.png\" alt=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" title=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nChecking the current permissions, and… bingo! roles/bigquery.dataEditor is one of the available roles. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss5.png\" alt=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" title=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we expand the graph’s nodes that we used in this chain of attacks, you can clearly see the attack path: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-primul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through the VM\" title=\"Attack path through the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the bigquery.dataEditor role, the attacker can now: \n\n* view data and metadata, \n* modify data and metadata, \n* delete tables. \n\n This breach could be avoided by: \n\n* ensuring the VM does not have vulnerabilities, and patching the Log4J one, \n* isolating the Compute Instance from the Internet by closing the exposed port, if possible, \n* restricting the Service Account’s permissions as much as possible,\n* making sure secrets are cleared from the VM files.   \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss6.png\" alt=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" title=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### Scenario 2: compromised user \n\nExpanding the Users node, we see that there are three users that have access to the BigQueryTable.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ultimul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through user compromise\" title=\"Attack path through user compromise\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf a hacker were to take over any of those accounts, for example, by stealing credentials, our customer’s data would be at risk. If one of the three users that have access to the table does not have MFA enforced, then the attacker can compromise the account.  \n\nEnabling MFA would prevent this. \n\nBesides this, a common mistake is focusing on protecting your environment from the outside, and forgetting about your own users. If one of the employees in the organization has too many permissions, they may produce damage without intention. By exploring the account and looking at resources, a user can accidentally modify or delete an asset. \n\nThis is why the Least Privilege Principle is so important – always limit the users’ access as much as possible and only assign the necessary permissions. \n\nWe believe that context is the future of cloud security. We’ve seen how the most simple relations between assets can be leveraged by attackers to take over cloud assets; and if your customers’ data is stored in those assets, the greater the prize is for hackers – and they will do anything to get it."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","description":"The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) of the Department of Homeland Security is now embarking on its third cyber vulnerability review since the body was created in February 2022.

During August, when lots of people were on summer vacation, a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory was exposed.  \n\nAs with the two vulnerabilities the CSRB reviewed previously - Log4J in July of 2022 and Lapsus$ also in August of 2023 – the Azure Active Directory vulnerability highlights significant challenges in terms of remediation, due to the sprawling nature of cloud resources and their direct and indirect dependencies on assets that might, or might not, be affected.  \n\nEven for large organizations with sizeable security teams, navigating a complex dependency graph to understand which resources have dependencies on affected assets is a challenge. For SaaS startups with perhaps a handful of people building out their technology stack, such investigations are impossible.  \n\nAs a result, the findings of the CSRB’s reports and its recommendations for best practice build a strong case for contextually aware cloud security practices.  \n\n## How does this affect you (and everyone else)? \n\nIn its most recent announcement, the CSRB made it clear that identity access management (IAM) and authentication are in focus due to being one of the most vulnerable areas in a cloud environment. Identity management vulnerabilities are a key entry point for hackers, and SaaS companies and large enterprises are falling victim repeatedly. From IAM misconfigurations that CTOs and developers miss when setting up and managing their environment, to cloud service provider bugs, this area needs critical attention to ensure safe and secure cloud environments. \n\n## Did I just say cloud service provider bugs?  \n\nYes, I did. The incident in question that kicked off this latest review less than two months ago, was the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory (soon to be renamed Microsoft Entra ID) that was allowing hackers to fabricate authentication tokens. Around 25 organizations including US government entities were impacted by this bug before it was discovered, with attackers stealing mailbox data and obtaining access to sensitive emails.  \n\nFor cloud native organizations building their entire business on public cloud platforms, this shared responsibility model is one of the most misunderstood (or ignored) aspects.  \n\nWhen the terms & conditions say that the cloud is a ‘shared responsibility’, it really is. It’s the cloud service provider’s job to secure the platform or infrastructure, and your job to secure the apps and data, and if one party fails (in this case, the cloud service provider – Microsoft Azure), your company, and potentially your customers and partners, are left exposed. \n\nThe CSRB’s previous two reports on [Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/csrb-log4j-key-findings-and-recommendations-summary) and [Lapsus$](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/review-attacks-associated-lapsus-and-related-threat-groups-executive-summary) have been very thorough and made some great recommendations that we hope will advance cybersecurity practices, which is why we’re eagerly waiting for CSRB’s report on cloud security. It not only promises a thorough set of recommendations for CISOs, CTOs, and developers, but it will also sound the alarm for cloud service providers.  \n\nAlthough the Cyber Safety Review Board has no regulatory power, its findings are transmitted to US President Biden and used to develop Executive Orders, so we can expect to see its influence in regulations such as [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), and perhaps best practices adopted into SOC 2, ISO 27001, and others. \n\n## The importance of contextual security \n\nWhat’s become evident is that simply informing businesses and cloud providers of the discovery of far-reaching misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is not enough. In fact, the potential workload created by responding to these challenges can be just as dangerous in that it can consume all an organization’s security resources.  \n\nContext is important and [contextual security](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) is the most significant development in cloud infrastructure security in recent years. Identifying that a VM has the Log4J vulnerability is not the same as saying that an Internet-facing VM has the same vulnerability. Of course, they are both just as vulnerable, but if the first VM is running in a private network, the severity is not as high as for the one accessible from the Internet. The risk is not the same, but the alert will be, and we all know alert fatigue is a very real problem.  \n\nWrong prioritization, or no prioritization at all, can make all the difference between a secure cloud environment and a breach."}}],"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3058837307","3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
