In this article, we will discuss all the deadlines by which you have to become compliant, details about the new requirements, and everything else you need to know about PCI DSS version 4.\n\n## Timeline and deadlines\n\nPCI DSS version 4 appeared at the end of March 2022 and its requirements will become mandatory in two phases: the first one is March of 2024, and the final one is March of 2025.\n\nThe new version brings considerable changes, but most of the new requirements will not be mandatory until 2025. However, companies that manage to fulfill them before 2025 can audit them.\n\nThe old version, PCI DSS 3.2.0., will remain active until the 31st of March, 2024, to allow companies enough time to recertify with the new version.\n\n## Changes in PCI DSS version 4, explained\n\nNew requirements have been added to all of the categories to better reflect the current cybersecurity landscape. Some examples of areas covered by the new requirements include the authentication process, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and others.\n\nMost of the sections have been revised or contain new requirements.\n\nPCI DSS is structured into twelve requirements, and each contains its own sections. The requirements are:\n\n### 1. Install and maintain network security controls\n\nThis requirement now specifies “network security controls” instead of “firewalls”, to cover more network security technologies. All of the sections in this category have been changed to the following:\n\n* 1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.\n* 1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.\n* 1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.\n* 1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.\n* 1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.\n\n### 2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components\n\nThis requirement was initially named “Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.”. Now, it refers to all of the company’s configurations, and not only to using vendor-supplied defaults. The sections in this category are the following:\n\n* 2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.\n* 2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.\n* 2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.\n\n### 3. Protect Stored Account Data\n\nWith the third requirement, the focus is switched to account data, compared to the old version, where “cardholder data\" was mentioned instead. New sections are added in relation to PAN (Primary Account Number) and SAD (Sensitive Authentication Data) which cover the storage, encryption and hashing of this data.\n\n* 3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.\n* 3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.\n* 3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.\n* 3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.\n* 3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.\n* 3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.\n* 3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key lifecycle are defined and implemented.\n\n### 4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks\n\n“Strong cryptography” is now part of the 4th requirement name, to highlight the importance of using appropriate algorithms. The new sections introduce rules regarding the storage and usage of keys and certificates. \n\n* 4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.  \n* 4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission. \n\n### 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software \n\nThis requirement has been renamed, replacing “anti-virus” with “malicious” software to cover a broader range of technologies. Moreover, sections in this category now regulate the frequency of scans and checks, as well as other aspects.\n\n* 5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.\n* 5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.\n* 5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.\n* 5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.\n\n### 6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software\n\nIn this requirement, one of the new sections added (6.4) refers to automating the detection and prevention of attacks over public-facing web apps. Sections 6.1 and 6.3 also contain new requirements.\n\n* 6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.\n* 6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.\n* 6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.\n* 6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.\n* 6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.\n\n### 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know\n\nThis requirement includes new rules regarding the review of user accounts and their privileges, as well as the management and privileges of applications and system accounts.\n\n* 7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.\n* 7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.\n* 7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).\n\n### 8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components \n\nMany new sections regarding MFA, credentials and the entire authentication process have been added in this requirement. Two examples of changes that companies compliant with PCI DSS have to implement now are: the minimum length of a user account password has increased from 7 to 12 characters, and companies are not allowed to store passwords/passphrases in scripts or files.\n\n* 8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.\n* 8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.\n* 8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.\n* 8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.\n* 8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.\n* 8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.\n\n### 9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data \n\nThis requirement does not have many changes. Some sections that refer to roles and responsibilities, as well as the frequency of device inspections have been added.\n\n* 9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.\n* 9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.\n* 9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.\n* 9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.\n* 9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.\n\n### 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data \n\nNew sections in this requirement regulate the automation of logging, prompt response to failed security controls, as well as how often logs should be reviewed:\n\n* 10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.\n* 10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.\n* 10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.\n* 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.\n* 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.\n* 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.\n* 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.\n\n### 11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly\n\nThis category includes the following:\n\n* a new requirement to manage all applicable vulnerabilities,\n* a new requirement to perform internal vulnerability scans via authenticated scanning,\n* a new requirement to deploy a change-and-tamper-detection mechanism to alert for unauthorized modifications to the HTTP headers and contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser, [according to PCI SSC](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r1.pdf).\n\nThe full list of the sections included in this requirement is:\n\n* 11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.\n* 11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.\n* 11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.\n* 11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.\n* 11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.\n* 11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.\n\n### 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs\n\nThe title modification reflects that the focus is on organizational policies and programs. In PCI DSS version 4, requirements specify that the audited company should, at least every 12 months:\n\n* document and review cryptographic cipher suites and protocols,\n* review hardware and software components,\n* document the PCI DSS scope,\n* review and update the security awareness program, among other requirements, which are presented below.\n\n \n\n* 12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.\n* 12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.\n* 12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.\n* 12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.\n* 12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.\n* 12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.\n* 12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.\n* 12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.\n* 12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.\n* 12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.\n\n## What do you have to do now? \n\nYou have to become PCI-DSS version 4 certified until the 31st of March 2024. There are two possible paths for your company:\n\n1. Your company is already PCI-DSS certified, so until the first deadline you must cover some of the new requirements and until the last deadline all of them, or\n2. Your company is not PCI-DSS certified, so you have to start from the beginning with the new PCI-DSS version and fulfill all requirements according to the specified deadlines.\n\nThis new version of PCI DSS brings considerable changes, and the process of achieving compliance with PCI DSS can be long and cumbersome.\n\nCyscale helps companies accelerate their cloud compliance process and ace audits by providing:\n\n* security controls that check if you’re implementing the requirements correctly, and\n* a page for each standard where you can track your progress and history.\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud Security Challenges: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Solutions for 2023","seoTitle":"Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges: Threats and Solutions for 2023","description":"Understand the top 10 cloud security challenges, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, and learn how to build a roadmap to create a robust cloud security strategy for 2023 and beyond.

Protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance has become paramount for professionals like Solutions Architects, CISOs, Cloud Security Researchers, DevOps Engineers, and others in the technology space tasked with ensuring transformative technologies remain secure. \n\nBut what exactly are the top cloud security challenges, and why are they a matter of pressing concern? Whether its data breaches caused by cyberattacks or vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, cloud security threats are multifaceted and evolving, quickly outpacing our human ability to keep up. \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top 10 cloud security challenges and present a roadmap for creating a robust cloud security strategy, with real-life examples, actionable solutions, and insights to aid your journey towards a secure cloud. \n\n## Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges \n\nThe digital landscape is filled with opportunities, but it is not without its obstacles. Cloud security challenges represent significant hurdles that organizations must overcome to fully leverage the power of cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet's dive into the top 10 challenges that are shaping the conversation in 2023: \n\n### 1. Vulnerabilities in Cloud Infrastructure: \n\nThe rise of cloud computing has unveiled a plethora of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Whether it's poorly designed APIs or weak authentication protocols, these vulnerabilities are often the entry points for unauthorized access. \n\nThe famous [Equifax data breach in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) occurred due to a vulnerability in an Apache Struts framework that allowed attackers to leak data using a vulnerable API. That breach affected approximately 147 million customers. \n\n### 2. Security Threats from Hackers and Malware: \n\nHackers continually evolve their techniques to breach cloud security defenses or simply take services offline. From sophisticated malware to phishing attacks and holding services to ransom, the threats are relentless and require constant vigilance and real-time security solutions.  \n\nIn early 2023, one botnet conducted a complex DDoS attack that was able to issue between 50 and 70 million requests per second originating from different cloud providers, [according to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/). VMs in the cloud can be both targets of DDoS attacks, as well as unwitting participants if a compromise goes undetected. \n\n### 3. Misconfigurations and Human Errors: \n\nSimple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic data breaches and with many companies facing a complex and sprawling cloud infrastructure it’s easy to make mistakes. Human error, whether accidental or due to lack of understanding of cloud configurations, is a consistent challenge. \n\nLet’s look at a common cloud misconfiguration example: your S3 bucket, which contains sensitive data about your customers, is publicly accessible. It sounds obvious, but a simple setting - making the bucket private - can prevent someone from the Internet accessing the data. However, if you are not aware of that configuration, this simple oversight might become a significant problem for your company; this is why it is very important to continuously monitor for misconfigurations and ensure you fix any findings in a timely manner. \n\n### 4. Insider Threats and Unauthorized Access: \n\nFrom disgruntled employees to compromised credentials, insider threats pose a unique and often overlooked challenge. Rigorous access control and monitoring are essential.  \n\nMoreover, a robust offboarding process for users is important to ensure that former employees no longer have access to the company’s assets after they have left the organization. Although the process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious, there should be a well-defined set of steps to check access rights when an employee leaves the company. After all, a favorite exercise of compliance auditors is to check a list of recently departed employees against current permissions and entitlements.  \n\n### 5. Cloud Service Providers and Shared Responsibility Model: \n\nUnderstanding the shared responsibility model with cloud service providers (CSPs) like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is vital. The delineation of responsibilities can sometimes be blurred, leading to security gaps.  \n\nFor example, if a user thinks that the cloud provider secures a virtual machine, they might neglect:  \n\n* closing management ports such as RDP (3389) and SSH (22), \n* using network security tools (such as firewalls, access control lists, network security groups), \n* managing VM disk encryption. \n\nThis might leave the VM unprotected because of the expectation that security is ‘somebody else’s problem’. \n\n### 6. Data Breaches and Loss: \n\nProtecting sensitive data is at the heart of cloud security. Data breaches and loss due to cyberattacks, human error, or even natural disasters can have devastating effects on organizations. Having PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stolen or leaked can lead to very grave consequences for a company. \n\nIn January 2023, the American wireless network provider T-Mobile revealed that a data breach that [potentially affected 37 million accounts occurred](https://www.reuters.com/technology/t-mobile-says-investigating-data-breach-affecting-37-mln-accounts-2023-01-19/) during 2022. Names, billing addresses, emails and phone numbers were some of the data that was leaked through an API with no authorization. Immediately in the wake of the news, T-Mobile stock fell 1%, and the company is currently under investigation by the FCC which could lead to further penalties.  \n\n### 7. Non-Compliance and Legal Risks: \n\nAdhering to regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA in the cloud can be complex. Non-compliance carries both legal risks and potential damage to reputation, especially for organizations in regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare. Compliance with international standards and laws ensures that: \n\n* Your company follows current cybersecurity best practices, \n* The reputation of your company is well maintained due to the continuous efforts to remain compliant. \n\nTo understand how serious non-compliance penalties can be, HIPAA is a good example. The maximum financial penalty for a HIPAA financial is almost $2 million, while criminal penalties can put the wrong-doer in jail for up to 10 years. It’s worth noting that regulation is also trending in the direction of at fault executives being held personally accountable, including jail time, to ensure that infringements can’t be offset by profits.  \n\nOne of the worst HIPAA violation cases happened in 2008 in one of the UCLA Health System hospitals. Employees accessed celebrity patients' medical records without authorization. A settlement of $865,000 was paid by the hospital, and the employees faced disciplinary actions. In general, employee discipline only goes as far as termination of employment but in some cases, employees have done time behind bars. \n\n### 8. Security Controls and Configurations: \n\nA security control in the cloud is a measure implemented based on a recommendation, a best practice or a requirement, designed to ensure that security and compliance of cloud resources and configurations are achieved.  \n\nImplementing and managing the right security controls and configurations is critical and tools like a Cloud Security Posture Management ([CSPM) platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) can be instrumental in managing these aspects effectively. Some tools, like Cyscale, go even further and visibility is greatly improved by bringing all of the security controls into one place, compared to multiple lists and dashboards of controls for each cloud provider, which can make it particularly challenging to see the big picture in the case of multi-cloud infrastructures. \n\n### 9. Endpoint Security and Real-time Protections: \n\nEndpoints are any device connected to a network. Examples of devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, point of sale terminals, and others. \n\nWith the rise of IoT and mobile workforces, securing endpoints and implementing real-time protections is more important than ever and more challenging given that these endpoints are often in the possession of individuals or at not easily accessible locations. A compromised or stolen laptop belonging to a senior engineer might be a good example here.  \n\nReal-time protection allows for threat detection and rapid response to attacks as they happen, as well as data loss prevention. For example, if you detect that a suspicious identity has connected to one of your VMs in the cloud, you can quickly act and cut off that identity before it can pivot to other cloud resources in your infrastructure. \n\n### 10. Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud Environments: \n\nManaging security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduces complexity.  \n\nMulti-cloud setups demand the appropriate handling of various security controls specific to each cloud provider and maintaining visibility across them, while hybrid models require seamless integration and consistent policies between on-premises and public cloud assets. In both cases, the complexity of the infrastructure and policies increases, making it crucial to stay on top of your security posture. \n\n \n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the cloud environment, robust strategies, and leveraging solutions like [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nThe good news? These challenges aren't insurmountable. In the sections that follow, we'll explore best practices to fortify your cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Section 2: Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment. Whether you're a CISO, a Cloud Security Expert, or a Senior System Administrator, this roadmap is tailored to meet the unique requirements of your organization's cloud security posture. \n\n### 1.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given best practices. \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in cloud security and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with the challenges of securing cloud resources.

As cloud services and cloud computing advance, the importance of cloud compliance becomes increasingly crucial. Dive into this guide as we explore the foundations and best practices of [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/). \n\n## The Basics of Cloud Compliance \n\n### What is Cloud Compliance? \n\nCloud compliance refers to the standards and laws set by regulation bodies to ensure data stored on the cloud remains safe, private, and within the boundaries of set cybersecurity rules. These rules often pertain to industries handling sensitive data, like healthcare (with HIPAA requirements) or e-commerce (following PCI DSS guidelines). \n\n### Key Regulations and Standards \n\n* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: This standard is focused around safeguarding credit card transactions. It regulates how cardholder data is stored and transmitted. \n* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: HIPAA is a United States healthcare law that refers to patient data and how it should be stored and used by companies. Moreover, this law covers how companies should act if patient PII is leaked. \n* **SOC 2**: Evaluates a company's information systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. \n* **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**: Provides standards and guidelines for federal agencies to architect and secure their information systems. There are three frameworks that can be used when establishing compliance with the [NIST standard](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/nist-compliance/): NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST 800-53, and NIST 800-171. \n* **ISO 27001**: This standard ensures that the organization has an effective and secure information security management. \n* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: GDPR is the most well-known and important European regulation protecting personal data. \n\n## Shared Responsibility Model \n\nThe shared responsibility model is a concept that defines how security responsibilities are divided between the cloud service provider (CSP), and the cloud user. This model outlines which party is responsible of each component of a cloud environment. For example, the cloud service provider is responsible of the physical security of the cloud computing infrastructure, while the customer takes care of their apps, data, and workloads. \n\nThe most popular cloud service providers are: \n\n1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\n2. Google Cloud \n\n3. Microsoft Azure \n\nAll major providers have, and regularly renew, their certificates of compliance with regulations. However, the weight of these regular updates also falls on the users’ shoulders: they still have the responsibility of getting certified to prove that the way they make use of cloud services (for apps, data, and workloads) matches the standard requirement. \n\n## Best Practices for Cloud Compliance \n\n### 1. Regular Audits \n\nRoutine checks are critical to identify potential vulnerabilities. Utilize tools like [cloud misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) to improve your cloud's security posture. \n\n### 2. Automation in Compliance \n\nBy integrating automation in compliance processes, you can help your company streamline future audits and achieve compliance easier. The Cyscale Cloud Platform removes a lot of the manual work that’s usually involved in preparing for and gathering evidence for an audit, offering support for popular standards such as [PCI DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/) or [ISO27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/). \n\n### 3. Education and Training \n\nThe realm of cloud security and compliance is ever-evolving. Continuous learning ensures your organization adheres to best practices, especially concerning cybersecurity. Moreover, conducting training for all employees of your company to help them understand how current prevalent attacks such as phishing work and how to protect themselves from them is a necessary step to protecting your organization. \n\n### 4. Data Management and Security \n\nGuard your sensitive data, with special attention for multi-cloud environments. While data security is vital in any computing environment, multi-cloud environments introduce additional complexities that require a heightened level of vigilance. Embrace encryption, multi-factor authentication, and API-level security. \n\n## Navigating Challenges \n\n### 1. Common Challenges in Cloud Compliance\n\nTo be able to address challenges in cloud compliance, you need to understand what some of the most common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are: \n\n* Poor access control, \n* Insufficient logging and monitoring, \n* Lack of encryption or the use of inadequate cryptographic algorithms, \n* Weak authentication, and others. \n\n### 2. Case Studies \n\nDive into scenarios where businesses faced cloud security challenges and understand the strategies they employed. Two examples of situations Cyscale has been helping companies with are: \n\n* [Lack of contextual visibility](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/) in a complex cloud environment \n* [A time-consuming compliance process](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech/) \n\n## How can Cyscale help? \n\nOffering unparalleled contextual visibility across cloud and data repositories, Cyscale grants organizations the power to scrutinize everything from resource-level configurations to their holistic compliance posture.
