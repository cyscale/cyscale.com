Following cybersecurity best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its cloud computing environments.\n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments and prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.webp\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege for access control, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all cloud data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks and data breaches.. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 security controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies regulatory compliance requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. healthcare federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous regulatory requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation.\n\nTo read more about these compliance standards, as well as NIST, check out our [whitepaper](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/the-complete-guide-to-cloud-compliance/). \n\nUnderstanding **cloud compliance** is crucial for organizations that want to ensure both the security and legality of their cloud operations. The constantly changing landscape of regulations demands a comprehensive approach to compliance, aligning with various standards such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.

This version is bringing considerable changes to the old [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/). Let's examine them and understand what they might mean to your company.  \n\n## The Changes \n\n### 1. The structure of the standard has changed. \n\nInstead of 14 clauses in Annex A that categorized the controls, ISO 27001:2022 groups all controls into four themes: \n\n* People (8 controls), \n* Organizational (37 controls), \n* Technological (34 controls),  \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\n### 2. Some controls have been merged or renamed. \n\nISO 27001:2022 contains 93 controls, instead of 114. Let’s look at examples of controls that have been modified: \n\n1. **A.18.1.1** Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements, and \n2. **A.18.1.5** Regulation of cryptographic controls. \n\nHave been merged into: \n\n1. **A.5.31** Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. \n\nA control that remained the same but has been moved to a different section is: \n\n> **A.18.1.2 Intellectual property rights.**  \n\nIt has been modified to: \n\n> **A.5.32 Intellectual property rights.** \n\n### 3. New controls have been added \n\nBelow, you can see the list of the 11 new controls added to Annex A of the ISO 27001:2022 standard. \n\n1. Threat intelligence (A.5.7) \n2. Information security for the use of cloud services (A.5.23) \n3. ICT readiness for business continuity (A.5.30) \n4. Physical security monitoring (A.7.4) \n5. Configuration management (A.8.9) \n6. Information deletion (A.8.10) \n7. Data masking (A.8.11) \n8. Data leakage prevention (A.8.12) \n9. Monitoring activities (A.8.16) \n10. Web filtering (A.8.23) \n11. Secure coding (A.8.28) \n\nA notable control is 5.23, “Information security for the use of cloud services”, since now, cloud security has a dedicated control. This preventative control is designed to keep risk at a minimum and regulate the management and usage of cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This control covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n\n### 4. Controls have attributes \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001-and-iso27002-2022-updates), controls can now be categorized based on 5 different attributes, with the mentioned values: \n\n* **Control type** (preventive, detective, corrective) \n* **Information security properties** (confidentiality, integrity, availability) \n* **Cybersecurity concepts** (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover) \n* **Operational capabilities** (governance, asset management, etc.) \n* **Security domains** (governance and ecosystem, protection, defense, resilience) \n\nUsing these attributes, your company can organize the controls based on their scope. \n\n## What does this mean to a CISO? \n\nThe [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) certification has a three-year validity, and the old version of the standard will be valid until it expires. Therefore, companies have a three-year period to recertify and become compliant with the new version of ISO 27001. This means that, at the latest, companies must recertify before the 31st of October 2025.  \n\nThe process of obtaining the [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) certification is time-consuming and difficult. However, you can make this task easier with Cyscale. \n\nCyscale helps you become compliant with international standards by providing hundreds of controls that help you secure your cloud environment, ensure you have implemented the requirements for international standards, and also aid you when going through audits. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","seoTitle":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","description":"Serverless computing is a collection of services provided by cloud vendors.

It allows users to write and execute code in the cloud without setting up the environment and allocating resources such as VMs beforehand. \n\nBenefits of serverless computing are: \n\n* **A pay-as-you-go model**, allowing code to only run when needed, \n* **No server management required**, since your code is running in the cloud, and you don't have to deal with the environment settings, \n* **Granular updates and patches** that allow developers to make changes at function-level and quickly deploy new versions, \n* **High reliability applications**, since the code runs on the cloud. \n\n## Services offered by cloud vendors \n\nTo further understand what serverless computing has to offer, we must look at services on the market and their features.  \n\n### 1. AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate \n\n**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that allows users, through functions, to run event-driven code without server provisioning or management. AWS Lambda can be used for: \n\n* File processing, \n* Stream processing, \n* Web and mobile applications, \n* IoT backends, and others. \n\nThe event-driven flows help reduce costs for users and add flexibility. Lambda functions are triggered by events, and customers only pay for the time the code is running.  \n\nMoreover, when creating a Lambda function, you can either start writing a function from scratch, or use sample code such as Amazon’s blueprints or the AWS Serverless Application Repository to implement your desired code. \n\n**AWS Fargate** is a compute engine that provides a serverless solution for application deployment by removing the need for infrastructure management. \n\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a service that allows Kubernetes instances to run both in the cloud and on-premises. EKS, together with AWS Fargate, produce a serverless solution for containers. \n\nFargate can also be used with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), with no additional changes required for your applications. \n\n### 2. Azure Serverless  \n\nMicrosoft Azure offers a collection of serverless compute solutions. Just like AWS Lambda, Azure Serverless enables its users to deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nSome of the Azure compute services are: \n\n* **Serverless Functions.** Just like AWS Lambda, Azure allows users to write event-driven code in their preferred language. Costs are applied only when the code is being executed, \n* **Serverless Kubernetes.** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), together with AKS virtual nodes, provide a serverless solution that reduces the infrastructure management workload of Kubernetes clusters. \n* **Serverless Containerized Microservices.** With this solution, applications are deployed in containers without managing the infrastructure,  \n* **Serverless Application Environments.** Using Azure App Service, web, mobile, and API applications are hosted in a fully managed environment.  \n\nAzure also provides low-code or no-code application development with Power Apps. This feature allows developers to construct applications using drag-and-drop functionalities, connectors, and readily-available solutions for common use cases. \n\n### 3. Cloud Run and Cloud Functions by Google Cloud \n\nThese two solutions offered by Google Cloud provide serverless compute services.  \n\n**Cloud Run** is an application development tool that separates infrastructure management from the code by placing applications in containers. Using Cloud Run, microservices can be deployed without specific configurations. It is highly scalable, and it can scale to zero – this means that if a service has no requests, all containers are removed, reducing costs. It supports the following programming languages: Go, Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, as well as others. \n\n**Cloud Functions** is a similar service to AWS Lambda and Azure Serverless. \n\n## Possible vulnerabilities of serverless computing \n\n### 1. Lack of source code security \n\nMany cyber attacks are successful due to poor code security.  \n\nAccording to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), one of the most common attacks on web applications in 2022 was SQL Injection. Whether an application is hosted in the cloud or not, user input should always be treated very carefully. \n\nTo correctly handle data received from users, you should sanitize it correctly and use prepared statements. \n\n### 2. Outdated or unpatched libraries, packages, and dependencies \n\nAnother element that affects applications' security is the libraries, packages, technologies, and dependencies used.  \n\nIn 2021, a critical vulnerability was discovered. Log4j, a popular Java framework used for logging messages in applications, introduced a massive flaw: it allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host machine. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as Log4Shell, [affected around 3 billion devices](https://www.acaglobal.com/insights/log4shell-vulnerability-what-we-know-and-action-steps-take).   \n\nServerless functions in the cloud were not immune to this attack. The functions written in Java that were using Log4j were vulnerable to Log4Shell. \n\nWhile not having to deal with underlying infrastructure management is an advantage of serverless computing, technologies used by developers still have to be used safely. \n\nHow do you protect your code from such vulnerabilities? \n\n* Only use trusted libraries, \n* Apply updates and patches as they appear, \n* Continuously assess your code, \n* Remove any unnecessary dependencies. \n\n### 3. Monitor your cloud infrastructure \n\nThis measure is a given. Log and monitor what your applications do to identify any odd behavior.  \n\nDocument every event that interacts with your code and see how your applications respond.  \n\n### 4. Integrate cryptography into your code \n\n[Encrypt sensitive data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) to ensure confidentiality in your applications’ flow. You should encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest data using AES. \n\nMoreover, safely store secrets and keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or in your cloud using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault,  \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\nDo not store keys, connection strings, or passwords in the source code or in plain text. \n\n### 5. Too much information is disclosed in error messages. \n\nWe’ve all encountered verbose error messages. \n\nDevelopers should not disclose information about errors or exceptions to the user.

SOC (Service and Organization Controls) 2 is an international standard developed by AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). In the context of **[cloud compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/)**, understanding SOC 2 requirements in your AWS environment is crucial for data security.\n\nIn this article, we will understand what requirements your company needs to fulfill to obtain the [SOC 2 certifications](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/) and how to implement them correctly in your AWS environment. \n\n### The requirements \n\nFirstly, the rules within SOC 2 are grouped by 5 TSC (Trust Service Criteria): \n\n1. Security \n2. Availability \n3. Processing Integrity \n4. Confidentiality \n5. Privacy \n\nSOC 2 has 64 mandatory trust service criteria, based on these which the company creates controls to achieve compliance. In this article, we will look at a few of the criteria required, how to implement them in your AWS environment and how to check if your implementation is complete. \n\n##### A checklist \n\n### Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials \n\nMFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a mechanism that adds additional steps to the authentication flow and requests supplementary credentials. These credentials can be: \n\n* What you know (for example: a password) \n* What you have (for example: a smart card) \n* What you are (for example: a fingerprint) \n\nTo fulfill this criteria, introduced under the “Security” section, you need to enable MFA when accessing the AWS Management Console. As a result, users will be prompted to enter their username and password (which is the first step, or the first factor of the authentication), and then an authentication code that is sent to their device. A biometrics-enabled device can be used instead as well. \n\nYou can configure MFA for IAM users or the AWS account root user. \n\nSteps to enable MFA in your AWS environment, according to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html). \n\n6. Install an authenticator app on your MFA device, use a FIDO2 device or specialized hardware devices such as TOTP tokens. \n7. Enable the MFA device from the AWS Management Console (if using an authenticator app, you can also use AWS CLI or AWS API). \n\nIf your company is using an external identity provider, you have to ensure that MFA is configured for access to the AWS console. \n\nTo check if users have MFA enabled, or to gain actionable insights regarding IAM, book a free assessment now.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n<div class=\"pb-0 pt-4 lg:pb-0 lg:pt-4 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">Start assessment</button></a></div>\n\n### Restricts Access \n\nThis criteria, in the “Security” TSC refers to restricting traffic to and from any cloud services and assets hosted in the cloud. This includes: \n\n* Closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* Requiring authenticated access to services such as FTP, SMB, and others. \n\nTo close an open port, follow these steps: \n\n1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. \n2. From the EC2 dashboard, on the left pane, click Security Groups. \n3. For each security group, click the Inbound Rules tab, and remove the rules that allow access to the ports you want to close. Repeat the same for the Outbound Rules. \n4. Remember to click save. \n\n### Implements Boundary Protection Systems \n\nThe third requirement we will analyze under the \"Security\" section of SOC refers to the usage of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), IDS, IPS, and others.  \n\nIt is recommended that you secure your cloud infrastructure by using these utilities in order to limit traffic as much as possible and only allow access to resources when necessary. \n\nTo quickly deploy a firewall: \n\n* Log in to the AWS Management Console, \n* Open the Amazon VPC console, create a firewall subnet, and update your VPC Route Tables. \n* Configure the firewall policy by accessing the Amazon VPC console navigation pane under Network Firewall. Choose Firewall policies and add any desired configurations. \n\n### Creates and Maintains Records of System Storage Activities \n\nThis criteria, located under the “Processing Integrity” criteria, checks if logging is implemented in your cloud environment.  \n\nBy logging all user activities, you can: \n\n* Observe [misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/), \n* Identify any suspicious behavior, \n* Detect malicious attacks. \n\nTo enable logging in your AWS infrastructure, you can use Amazon CloudTrail. This solution tracks all actions performed in your cloud environment.  \n\nAmazon CloudTrail can be used together with Amazon CloudWatch to extend monitoring to applications and cloud assets and to analyze their health. \n\n**Amazon CloudTrail is enabled by default in your AWS account.** \n\n### Protects Encryption Keys \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is essential to ensure confidentiality of data. In the “Confidentiality” section of SOC 2, we have criteria for both encryption and key management.  \n\nIf key management is neglected, then encryption becomes useless. Keys must be generated, stored, used and destroyed safely to protect your data. \n\nAmazon offers a complete solution for proper key management. AWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) helps you properly deal with all of the processes in a cryptographic key’s lifecycle. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used:  \n\n* Through the AWS Management Console,  \n* Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### Finally, check your implementations \n\nBesides the criteria presented in this article, there are many more. \n\nAlthough so many requirements can quickly become overwhelming, Cyscale can help you easily keep track of what you’ve correctly implemented and what requires your attention on our [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) compliance page. \n\nMany technical controls in Cyscale can be mapped to SOC 2 criteria to provide visibility in your cloud environment and prove compliance. \n\nA few examples of controls that apply to the presented requirements (and more) are: \n\n* Ensure all users have MFA configured. \n* Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions. \n* Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 (SSH). \n\nB﻿ook a demo now to use these controls and many more and assess your cloud security posture in AWS.\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-6 lg:pb-12 lg:pt-6 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Product"],"title":"Cloud Queues Security Best Practices","seoTitle":"Cloud Queues Security Best Practices","description":"A queue is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data in efficiently.

A message queue, in the context of the cloud, is a service used to temporarily store data before it is processed.  \n\nA message queue's role is to act like a buffer; if a service is too busy processing data and would otherwise drop traffic, then that traffic is added to a queue for temporary storage. \n\nA message queue usually works based on the FIFO mechanism. FIFO (First In, First Out) allows easy retrieval of messages based on their order of arrival to ensure a smooth process. That means the messages are extracted from the queue in the order they arrive. \n\n## Cloud vendors and queues \n\nLet’s look at solutions offered by cloud vendors and understand how to secure queues used in the cloud infrastructure. \n\n### 1. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) \n\nThis solution helps you manage distributed systems and asynchronous tasks by storing messages in a buffer and waiting until the system is ready to process them. A few of the benefits offered by Amazon through this service are: \n\n* Security, \n* Durability, \n* Availability,  \n* Scalability, and others. \n\n### 2. Azure Queue Storage \n\nAzure Queue Storage helps you store large volumes of messages that can be accessed using authenticated HTTP or HTTPS requests. This type of storage offered by Microsoft Azure is useful in managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring no data loss occurs. \n\n### 3. Cloud Tasks in Google Cloud \n\nCloud Tasks is a slightly different service than we've discussed so far; Google Cloud allows users to store asynchronous tasks in queues and easily manage them.  \n\nThis type of queue can be used as a task scheduling system since you can set a time when a task should be executed. \n\nHowever, even though the queues in Cloud Tasks are designed for tasks, message passing is a use case of the queues.  \n\nAnother solution, very similar to Cloud Tasks, is Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub is a message queueing system that functions on a predefined set of rules, where there is a set of Subscribers, who all receive the queued messages from the Publisher when an event occurs. \n\n## Queues in the Cloud - Best Practices \n\nWhen thinking about [data security in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/), we think of secure storage and assets protection. For this reason, it is very easy to overlook where your sensitive data might end up; and queues are one place. \n\n**Don’t leave queues out of your data security program**; secure every state of data and ensure that you don’t have any vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet’s look at best practices for securing queues in the cloud. \n\n### 1. Encrypt the data that arrives in queues. \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is critical in data security; it ensures that your traffic is confidential. \n\nWhether you implement client-side encryption (which means encrypting the data before sending it) or server-side encryption (where the cloud vendor deals with the encryption process), you need to ensure you don't have information in plain text. \n\nBesides these options, you can also make sure that, after leaving the queue, your data is stored encrypted. For example, AWS S3 assets allow users to set default encryption for data that arrives, so new objects are always stored encrypted.  \n\n### 2. Log actions that affect queues. \n\nKeep details of requests made to the queue; whether they are successful or failed, ensure you keep track of what happens to queues. Important signals that can help you identify any irregularities in your queues' configuration are:  \n\n* Authentication attempts,  \n* Latency, \n* Queue depth (the number of messages waiting to be processed), \n* Request and response sizes, and others. \n\nWhy are these parameters important? For example, if your cloud infrastructure is under a DDoS attack, you can quickly identify that by looking at requests and their size; such attacks usually send either very large volumes of data often or big requests that are meant to slow down your system. \n\n### 3. Restrict access to queue management and ensure access control \n\nImplement [the Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only allow a small group of users to change queue configurations. Following [recommendations offered by Google](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/secure-queue-configuration), deploy specific roles like Queue Administrator and assign them only to users who require those roles. \n\nBesides management, you should also have in place good access control rules. For example, IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies that restrict unnecessary access should be implemented and applied to queues. \n\n### 4. Configure a dead-letter queue \n\nA dead-letter queue (DLQ) is a type of queue designed for messages that, for various reasons, cannot be stored in the queue and processed correctly. Some of the reasons why messages may end up in DLQs are: \n\n* The application in which the queue is used has logical errors, \n* The message length limit was exceeded, \n* The queue is full, and others. \n\nDead-letter queues are useful for debugging what went wrong with the messages’ processing. For example, using a DLQ, you can look at rejected messages and then redirect them to your main queues. \n\n### 5. Use private endpoints for your queues \n\nAlthough most cloud providers enable you to have storage assets (and queues) open to the internet, it is the safest to use private endpoints. \n\nThis can be done using a Private Link, which creates a private connection between the services in the cloud and the queue.  \n\nThis way, traffic does not unnecessarily reach the public internet, and a layer of security is added. \n\n### 6. Configure a good retention period \n\nThe retention period refers to how long messages are stored in the queue before they are deleted. **A longer retention period** is recommended to provide flexibility in your environment and allow some time between the moment a message is received and when it is processed. \n\nFor example, Amazon SQS lets you configure a retention period between 1 minute and 14 days. \n\n## Protect your data using Cyscale \n\nAfter understanding best practices regarding queue security, it’s time to ensure you’re implementing them.  \n\nYou can easily do this using Cyscale!

It is easy to overlook even the smallest configuration and introduce a vulnerability in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nIn this article, you will find a comprehensive guide that will help you understand possible misconfigurations in your AWS cloud infrastructure and how to remediate them.  \n\n## Steps to secure your cloud environment \n\n### 1. Data classification \n\n[Classifying your cloud data](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) can help you easily sort, retrieve, and prioritize it. This is done using a tag (sometimes called a label), which is applied to cloud storage assets. In this way, that data is placed into one or more categories and can be identified more easily. \n\nBenefits of data classification include: \n\n* Risk management, \n* Compliance,  \n* Security. \n\nIn AWS, tags are key-value pairs that add metadata to your data. \n\nThe AWS documentation recommends using a three-tiered approach, with the following tags: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official,  \n* Secret. \n\nHowever, users can tailor data classification to their needs and use their own tags. In addition, **tag policies** can be used to standardize their creation and ensure consistency across all assets. \n\nTo accomplish classification using tags in your AWS environment, you have the following options: \n\n* Using the Amazon console, at resource level, where tags can be added either at creation or after, \n* Programmatically, using the Amazon API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. \n\nAccording to the AWS documentation, restrictions regarding tags include: \n\n* There cannot be more than 50 tags per resource, \n* Each tag key must be unique for each resource, \n* The maximum key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8, \n* The maximum value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. \n\n### 2. Encryption \n\nEncryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality because entities that do not have the decryption key cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, cannot read its content. \n\nThe two types of encryption mechanisms are: \n\n* **Symmetric encryption**, where the encryption and the decryption key are the same, and \n* **Asymmetric encryption**, where the two keys are different; one is called public key and the other private key. \n\nEncryption can be done in all three states of data: \n\n* [At rest,](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) \n* In transit, \n* In use. \n\nIn this article, we will discuss data encryption in the first two states, but [a more detailed article](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) regarding encryption also describes encryption in the last state of data. \n\nFor data in transit, AWS provides the following solution: \n\n1. Encrypt the data using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n2. Perform client-side encryption. This solution requires the user to encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud, but it is more difficult since the client has to deal with the encryption process, key management, and other services. \n\nFor data at rest, AWS provides encryption for the following services:  \n\n* Amazon EBS,  \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift,  \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nAWS uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm, an industry-recommended standard and one of the strongest algorithms for symmetric encryption. \n\nKey management is also a very important element of data encryption. If your keys are not stored safely, then no matter how strong the encryption algorithm is, a malicious party may be able to read your data. \n\nA few best practices regarding encryption keys are: \n\n* Do not store your keys in the same place as your data or in the source code, \n* Rotate and retire keys regularly to minimize the impact of a breach, \n* Manage key deletion, \n* Use Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs) to generate your keys. \n\nAWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) is a comprehensive solution that helps users deal with all the trouble that comes with cryptographic keys. \n\nAWS KMS helps you: \n\n* Create cryptographic keys, \n* Define policies and control how the keys are used, \n* Audit the keys usage to ensure they are used legitimately. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used: \n\n1. Through the AWS Management Console, \n2. Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### 3. Access control \n\nRegulating access control is an essential step to your [cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) program.  \n\nTo manage access control in AWS, you can use policies, which can be assigned at the following levels: \n\n* Users, \n* Groups of users, \n* Roles, \n* Resources. \n\nPolicies define permissions. To correctly implement them, use the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) to only allow access rights to the necessary users for the minimum amount of time possible.  \n\nLet’s look at an example where a policy is applied to a resource.  \n\nAn AWS S3 bucket is a type of asset used to store object-like data such as files, databases, and other unstructured data. \n\nA bucket policy contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied and is written in JSON.  \n\n```jsonld\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"S3PolicyId1\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\",\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"NotIpAddress\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*Policy source – docs.aws.amazon.com* \n\nAnalyzing the image above, we understand that the policy is applied to a bucket resource, the rule for the permission is “Deny”, and the result of the bucket policy is denying access to the objects stored in the specified bucket unless the requests are made with source IPs in the subnet 54.240.143.0/24. \n\n### 4. Data loss prevention \n\nData loss prevention (DLP) is a protection mechanism for sensitive data that ensures that no unintentional or malicious disclosures occur. DLP prevents data breaches by ensuring no confidential data is accidentally leaked, lost, or stolen. \n\n**Amazon Macie** is a data security and privacy service that protects users’ sensitive data using machine learning technologies and pattern matching. \n\nThis tool identifies sensitive data using **sensitive data discovery jobs**, which analyze S3 buckets. Sensitive data discovery jobs use pre-defined or user-defined lists (or a combination of both) to single out confidential data by matching patterns to the lists. \n\nA passport number is an example of sensitive data that Amazon Macie could match. This is because it has a set number of digits, some corresponding to the owner's region or country. \n\nAfter identifying sensitive data, Amazon Macie can: \n\n* use IAM policies to filter traffic to it,  \n* encrypt and decrypt data,  \n* perform logging and monitoring through AWS CloudTrail integration, and others.  \n\n### 5. Availability \n\nAvailability means that users should be able to access their data without disruptions at any point. \n\nA solution for availability in the cloud is **availability zones**. \n\nAn availability zone is a geographical area where groups of data centers are located. These data centers contain replicated data and provide redundancy regarding electrical power, networking, and connectivity. \n\nAn AWS region contains multiple AWS availability zones, all within 100km of each other, which are independent and provide redundancy. \n\nSome AWS regions around the globe are: \n\n* North America,  \n* South America, \n* Europe,  \n* China,  \n* South Africa, and others. \n\nThese regions provide high availability. \n\nAnother solution for availability is DDoS Protection. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are attempts to bring down a service or a resource by sending a large amount of traffic to them using controlled machines. \n\nAWS Shield is the AWS DDoS Protection service that protects applications hosted in the cloud. \n\nAWS Shield has two tiers: \n\n* Standard, \n* Advanced. \n\nBesides the features that come with the Standard plan, which are at network and transport layer, the Advanced tier of AWS Shield provides: \n\n* integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* real-time visibility into attacks,  \n* additional detection and mitigation of sophisticated DDOS attacks, and others. \n\n## Secure your cloud environment \n\nAfter understanding the security demands required for the cloud, implementing them seems like a daunting task.

Buckets are object storage services and are similar to folders; this type of storage is flexible and scalable and is ideal for large files and unstructured data. \n\n## Common S3 Bucket Misconfigurations \n\n### 1. Public access to a bucket is allowed. \n\nSometimes, Amazon S3 buckets are required to be publicly accessible. For example, this use case occurs when the owner intends to make data accessible to the internet.  \n\nHowever, breaches occur when a bucket that has sensitive information such [as PII (Personal Identifiable Information)](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) allows: \n\n* Public “READ” access, \n* Public “WRITE” access.  \n\nYou can grant and deny access to a bucket using **access lists** and **bucket policies**.  \n\nAn access control list (ACL) is a set of rules that limit access to buckets through permissions. It defines an account's access level over a bucket (for example, READ or WRITE).  \n\nA bucket policy also contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied, but it is a more modern solution because it can enable more complex filtering. It is a JSON-based access policy language. \n\nAmazon recommends that you no longer use ACLs beside special cases, in which you need to filter access to objects individually.  \n\n### 2. No at rest encryption is performed. \n\n[Data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) should always be encrypted to ensure confidentiality and improve your cloud data security.  \n\nPerforming encryption on the objects inside a bucket ensures that, even if a malicious entity gains access to your data, they cannot read it.  \n\nAWS provides multiple encryption options to protect data at rest. For example, you can enable default encryption and set it, so it automatically encrypts any new objects added to the bucket.  \n\nEncryption should be done using industry-recommended algorithms and strong cryptographic keys. A strong encryption algorithm is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 3. In transit encryption is not enabled. \n\nBesides the data that is already stored, you should also encrypt the data that travels to and from the S3 bucket.  \n\nThis step prevents eavesdropping attacks. It is not enough to store your data encrypted. Your efforts are wasted if it travels in plain text and attackers can read it. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nAnother solution for in motion encryption is preparing the data that is to be transported by encrypting it on the client-side. \n\n### 4. Logging is disabled. \n\nLogging an S3 bucket is an essential step in securing your data. With logging, you can record actions taken by users, keep log files for compliance purposes and understand what roles have permission to access data inside a bucket. \n\nThere are two solutions for AWS bucket logging: \n\n* Server access logging, and \n* AWS CloudTrail. \n\nWith server access logging, you obtain detailed records regarding requests that are made to a bucket. \n\nAWS CloudTrail is a comprehensive service that tracks user activity and API calls. It can be used to keep a record of who sends requests to a bucket.  \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that AWS CloudTrail does not log failed authentication attempts through incorrect credentials. However, it does track requests made by anonymous or unauthorized users. \n\n### 5. No regular backups are performed \n\nAttackers may not only try to steal your sensitive data, but they can also delete it. Therefore, ensuring regular and consistent backups is essential to configuring your buckets and providing availability. \n\nUsing AWS Backup, you can perform S3 bucket backups. Amazon supports the following types of backups: \n\n* **Continuous backups**, which allow data restoration from any moment in the last 35 days, \n* **Periodic backups**, which can be performed every 1 hour, 12 hours, or less often. \n\nAn important feature of AWS Backup is that [tags](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/), access control lists, and other metadata are also saved along with your data. \n\nAn additional layer of security can be added by using the MFA delete feature in AWS. This option requires a successful MFA before allowing a user to delete an object or bucket. \n\nMoreover, you can keep multiple versions of an object inside a bucket. This process is called versioning and can be used to recover objects from accidental deletion. \n\n## Do you have a complete cloud security program? \n\nIn this article, we’ve discussed many possible misconfigurations, along with best practices. However, in order to fully understand your public cloud infrastructure and find vulnerabilities, you need to have good visibility over your cloud environment.  \n\nUsing a new feature in Cyscale, the bucket graph, you can put in context all of your knowledge and grasp a better understanding of your infrastructure. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a bucket graph. \n\n![Bucket Graph in Cyscale](/img/23_blog-graph-bucket.webp#shadow \"Bucket Graph in Cyscale\")\n\nAlthough the bucket (shown on the right) has only two IAM policies attached, we can see that these have a significant impact on the infrastructure: the AmazonS3FullAccess policy gives full access rights to a specific user and to a VM that can assume an associated IAMRole.  \n\nIn addition, there's a lambda function that has a role which gives it permissions to perform actions on the bucket \n\nWithout context, we would not be able to understand a policy's impact and the associated risk. \n\nMoreover, the icon on the right shows us that the bucket violates three policies. Cyscale users can click on the icon and obtain more details regarding this alert. \n\nThis feature helps you quickly understand and fix any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities introduced in the cloud environment due to the bucket’s settings. \n\n  \n\nBesides the graph, you can also use controls to check your cloud configurations easily. Find any gaps in your buckets' configurations using Cyscale controls! Here are a few examples that can help you instantly check the most common misconfigurations regarding S3 buckets: \n\n* *Ensure S3 bucket ACL grants permissions only to specific AWS accounts* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* \n* *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes* \n* *Ensure that there are no publicly accessible objects in storage buckets* \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud ","seoTitle":"HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud ","description":"The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a United States federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and individuals’ personal health information (PHI).

According to the [Medicare Learning Network](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/HIPAAPrivacyandSecurity.pdf), the three rules are: \n\n* The Privacy Rule, \n* The Security Rule, \n* The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nWe will look at each in detail to understand how compliance with HIPAA can be achieved in the cloud. \n\n## The Privacy Rule \n\nThe Privacy Rule contains standards that regulate the usage and disclosure of PHI. This section of HIPAA includes a wide range of rules that protect an individual's rights to: \n\n* Access and obtain digital copies of their medical records, \n* Request corrections regarding their medical records, \n* Restrict access to some of their information. \n\nThe Privacy Rule also contains instructions for the medical provider. A medical professional must: \n\n1. Keep PHI secure and disable access to it unless the person requesting access is authorized to access it, \n2. Inform patients about their privacy rights and others. \n\n## The Security Rule \n\nThis rule refers to electronic PHI (ePHI). It requires that ePHI data is stored, accessed, and transferred under the three cybersecurity principles: \n\n1. Confidentiality,  \n2. Availability, \n3. Integrity. \n\nLet’s understand what these three principles require: \n\n* **Confidentiality**: Make sure no unauthorized individual can access or read the ePHI. \n* **Availability**: Authorized persons should be able at all times to access the ePHI, as needed. \n* **Integrity**: ePHI should not be altered or deleted by unauthorized entities. \n\n## The Breach Notification Rule \n\nThe third rule in HIPAA refers to how a medical professional should respond to a PHI breach.  \n\nThe parties that should always be notified of a breach are: \n\n* The affected individual or individuals, and \n* The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \n\n## Consequences of HIPAA violations \n\nSince HIPAA is a federal law, there are two types of penalties that can be applied: \n\n* Financial penalties, \n* Criminal penalties. \n\nThese repercussions depend on the gravity of the violation. According to [HIPAA Answers](https://www.hipaanswers.com/hipaa-violation-penalties/), there are four violation categories: \n\n1. A violation that was not known and could not have been realistically avoided. \n2. A violation that the responsible parties should have been aware of but could not have been avoided. \n3. A violation due to negligence, where correction attempts were made to correct it. \n4. A violation due to negligence, with no attempts made to correct it. \n\nThe **financial penalties** are also split into four categories: \n\n1. Minimum fine of $128 per violation up to $63,973, \n2. Minimum fine of $1,280 per violation up to $63,973, \n3. Minimum fine of $12,794 per violation up to $63,973, \n4. Minimum fine of $63,973 per violation up to $1,919,173. \n\n**Criminal penalties** are divided into three categories: \n\n* For reasonable cause or no knowledge of the violation: up to one year in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI under false pretenses: up to five years in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI for personal gain or malicious attempt: up to ten years in jail. \n\n## HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud: A Checklist \n\nAfter we've understood the importance of compliance with HIPAA, let's see the requirements that need to be fulfilled. They are grouped into three categories: \n\n* Technical Safeguards, \n* Administrative Safeguards, \n* Physical Safeguards.  \n\nLet’s look at them more in detail and understand how Cyscale can help you become compliant with HIPAA. \n\n### 1. Technical Safeguards \n\nTechnical Safeguards are split into four categories. We will also show you examples of controls in Cyscale to help you understand how easy it is to implement them and streamline the process of becoming compliant. \n\n* Access control – only authorized entities should access ePHI. \n* Audit control – access to ePHI should be recorded and examined. \n* Integrity – ePHI should not be altered or destroyed by unauthorized individuals. \n* Transmission security – ePHI should be safely transmitted over the network. \n\nExamples of controls for some of these safeguards are: \n\n* **Access control:** *Ensure network access rule for storage bucket is not set to publicly accessible* for Alibaba Cloud. \n* **Audit control:** *Ensure that Object-level logging for write events is enabled for S3 bucket* for AWS. \n* **Transmission security:** *Ensure 'Enforce SSL connection' is set to 'ENABLED' for MySQL Database Server* for Azure. \n\n### 2. Administrative Safeguards \n\n* **Security Management Process** – analyze potential risks and take protective measures, \n* **Security Personnel** – a security officer should be responsible for security policies and procedures, \n* **Information Access Management** – limit access to PHI to [the minimum necessary](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), \n* **Workforce Training and Management** – employees should receive training in PHI management and be supervised, \n* **Evaluation** – a periodic assessment of security policies should be performed. \n\nTwo examples of controls for the “Information Access Management” Safeguard are: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n\n### 3. Physical Safeguards \n\n* **Facility Access and Control** – access to a covered entity's facilities should be limited to authorized personnel, \n* **Workstation and Device Security** – policies and procedures should be implemented to regulate the usage and access to workstations and devices.  \n\nUse Cyscale to achieve compliance with HIPAA and other international standards. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"A Guide to Cloud Security Best Practices","seoTitle":"A Guide to Cloud Security Best Practices","description":"When it comes to data stored in the cloud, you must consider multiple aspects such as encryption, access control, backups, and how these map to the CIA triad.

This guide provides insights into best practices that are integral to this strategy.\n\nData security is one of the biggest concerns of cloud-based organizations. When you think about protecting data, you need to make sure you’re providing the following features:\n\n* Confidentiality,\n* Integrity,\n* Availability.\n\nMoreover, these three security principles need to be implemented for all three states of data, which are:\n\n* In motion,\n* In use,\n* At rest.\n\nThis mission may seem daunting. Let’s break it down and understand every step of the process of securing data. In this article, you will find out:\n\n* The type of attacks that threaten your data,\n* Cloud security best practices,\n* Security solutions on the market from cloud service providers,\n* How to identify any gaps in your security policies.\n\n## **How do you ensure confidentiality?**\n\nConfidentiality is a security principle that states that only authorized users should be able to access the data. It should not be visible to unauthorized entities.\n\n### **Encryption**\n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is the process of scrambling data to obtain unreadable ciphertext. The algorithm uses a key to encrypt it, and if you are not in possession of the decryption key, you cannot reverse it back to its original state.\n\nEncryption solutions for the three states of data are: \n\n* For in motion data: SSL/TLS. They are transport protocols that encrypt data in transit. \n* For in use data: memory encryption, called Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory. \n* [For at rest data:](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) industry-recommended symmetric algorithms such as AES-256 are used to perform full disk, database, file system, and cloud assets encryption and to safely store data. \n\nUsing these best practices, you can improve your cloud security posture and prevent data breaches or other security incidents.\n\n### **Access control** \n\nA layered approach should be used when securing data in the cloud. This is where a robust **[cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/)** becomes crucial. This means that encryption of data at rest should only be considered as the last measure of protection if access control rules are bypassed. \n\nYou must secure access to databases, buckets, and other storage assets by restricting it as much as possible. In doing this, you become compliant with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\nA few access control best practices for [database protection](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/) are:\n\n* Filter inbound and outbound traffic,\n* Secure your database connection,\n* Keep your connection details secret.\n\nFor [buckets that contain sensitive information](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/#storage-access), do not allow public read/write access and use access control lists to define granular rules.\n\nBesides access control, to ensure robust data protection, strong authentication mechanisms should be put in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a must-have security measure for cloud computing environments.\n\nBy implementing these IAM (Identity and Access Management) best practices, attack surface is reduced and your cloud infrastructure is secured.\n\n### **Data classification**\n\nClassifying data does not protect it on its own. However, this process can help you understand which is the most sensitive data in order to better focus your efforts to secure it.\n\nAWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, and Google Cloud provide labels or tags for users to implement [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/). Labels/tags can be predefined by the public cloud vendor or can be user-defined according to the user’s specific needs.\n\n## **How do you ensure integrity?**\n\nEnsuring integrity means that data must not be altered in transit or at rest. Integrity is usually accomplished using hashes and checksums.\n\nThey are computed before the data is used or transferred and then again after. If the two values of hashes/checksums match, then the data was not altered in transit or at rest. Otherwise, that data was tampered with.\n\nLet’s look at public cloud vendors and how they provide data integrity services:\n\n* AWS S3 uses CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256 to check the data integrity after uploading/downloading,\n* Google Cloud also uses CRC32C checksums to verify data integrity.\n\n## **How do you ensure availability?**\n\nData availability means that any user should be able at any point to access their data without disruptions.\n\nFor data in the public cloud, vendors provide solutions to replicate and backup it in different data centers and regions.\n\nWe need to look at **availability zones** to understand availability in the cloud.\n\nAvailability zones are groups of data centers in the same region containing replicated data. If a data center fails, the other data center in the availability zone takes the responsibility, providing fault tolerance and increased availability and preventing data loss.\n\nMoreover, public cloud vendors support region pairs. A region is paired with another region at a great distance (for example, at least 300km away for Azure). If a natural disaster, civil unrest, or any other unforeseen events occur, the secondary region becomes the main source of cloud service.\n\nAnother service available in the public cloud that helps ensure availability is **DDOS protection**.\n\nDDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an attack designed to crash an application or a service by sending substantial amounts of traffic to it.\n\nA few examples of available DDOS services to secure cloud infrastructure are:\n\n* AWS Shield,\n* Azure DDOS Protection,\n* Google Cloud Armor.\n\n**Implementing our recommendations**\n\nEnsuring [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) is not an easy task. There are many aspects to be considered, and a small mistake can leave a vulnerability in your cloud environment.\n\nCyscale provides powerful dashboards to ensure visibility of your assets, the identities in your cloud, and an overview of your data security.\n\nMoreover, 400+ security controls ensure that your security teams have implemented the cybersecurity principles and best practices. Here are some examples of controls that can be used to ensure data security:\n\n* **In motion data encryption**: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Microsoft Azure\n* **At rest data encryption**: *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer*-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) for Google Cloud\n* **Access control**: *Ensure S3 bucket policy does not grant Allow permission to everyone* for AWS\n* **Data classification**: *Ensure Kubernetes Clusters are configured with Labels* for Google Cloud\n* **DDOS Protection**: *Ensure Anti-DDoS access and security log service is enabled* for Alibaba Cloud\n\nBefore diving into specific controls, it's essential to acknowledge the evolving **[cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/)** that businesses face. With a constantly changing digital landscape, understanding these challenges can help shape your security strategies more effectively."}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":36,"numPages":8,"currentPage":5,"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","seoTitle":"Sabrina Lupsan - Insights from a Cloud Security Analyst - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Discover how Sabrina Lupsan, a seasoned Cloud Security Analyst at Cyscale, integrates academic expertise and research to advance cloud security practices.","authorSlug":"sabrina-lupsan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1541236353","220583031","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
