Security\n\n   * Contains Security Incidents\n   * Communicates Remediation Activities\n2. Availability\n\n   * Identify environmental threats\n   * Measure Current Usage\n3. Processing Integrity\n\n   * Create and maintain records of system inputs\n   * Defines processing activities\n4. Confidentiality\n\n   * Identify confidential information\n   * Destroy confidential information\n5. Privacy\n\n   * Use clear and conspicuous language\n   * Collect information from reliable sources\n\n**For ISO 27001**, you need to:\n\n1. Implement an ISMS (Information Security Management Systems)\n2. Fulfill **7 requirements with 114 suggested controls** divided into 14 sections.\n\nThe requirements are described in the following clauses:\n\n* Clause 4: Context of the organization\n* Clause 5: Leadership\n* Clause 6: Planning\n* Clause 7: Support\n* Clause 8: Operation\n* Clause 9: Performance evaluation\n* Clause 10: Improvement\n\nIn the Annex of ISO 27001, you can find a list of controls and objectives to help you meet the requirements.\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/).\n\n**Price (of audit)**\n\n* For SOC 2, the cost depends on the type of audit and can range **between $5,000 and $60,000** with an average of about $20,000.\n* For ISO 27001, the price of an audit depends on the number of employees in the organization. It can go **as low as $5,400 up to $27,000**.\n\nIt is important to note that the price of implementing the standards may significantly increase the total cost of obtaining the accreditation.\n\nOne thing to note is that, although SOC 2 and ISO 27001 seem very different, their specifications overlap.\n\nThe level of similarity between the requirements of the two depends on:\n\n* The type of business you run\n* The scope of the audit\n\nThe similarity can be between 53% and 90%, according to AICPA’s mapping to ISO 27001.\n\nTaking into account all of the differences and similarities of the SOC 2 accreditation and the ISO 27001 certification, you can now choose the best standard for your company.\n\nFinally, implementing all the policies required by the described standards can be a difficult and time-consuming task.\n\nYou can make this process easier for you.\n\nWith [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can ensure easy and continuous compliance for ISO 27001.\n\nCyscale helps you meet the much-needed requirements described by this standard.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":63,"numPages":8,"currentPage":8,"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","seoTitle":"Sabrina Lupsan - Insights from a Cloud Security Analyst - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Discover how Sabrina Lupsan, a seasoned Cloud Security Analyst at Cyscale, integrates academic expertise and research to advance cloud security practices.","authorSlug":"sabrina-lupsan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
