And, because of that, \n\n* understanding how cloud assets are interconnected, \n* establishing correct policies, \n* regulating access control \n\nare all tasks that should be carefully approached when thinking about your company’s cloud. \n\nTherefore, it is necessary to take some steps to make sure your company’s cloud is secure. \n\nIn order to minimize risks and secure your cloud environment, you need to manage your cloud security posture.  \n\nIn this article, you will see how to improve it and provide a safe environment for your assets. \n\nHere are some key actions that you need to take to make sure that your cloud is secure. \n\n1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets \n2. Detect misconfigurations  \n3. Implement remediation for findings \n4. Ensure logging and monitoring \n5. Assure compliance with security standards \n\nLet us talk more about these tasks and how to accomplish them. \n\n<br/>\n\n**1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets** \n\nLooking at many configurations at once may become overwhelming very fast. \n\nIt is hard to notice flaws in your security design if discovery and visibility are not assured. \n\nDiscovery and visibility in cloud imply being able to visualize cloud assets in an organized and easily readable way, for example in a dashboard.  \n\nEven more useful is when visibility for each asset is enriched by additional context that may be provided in a graph view.\n\n![A graph from the Cyscale application.](/img/graph_image.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nLooking at: \n\n* policies, \n* configurations, \n* connections between assets \n\nin a centralized fashion can help in pointing out: \n\n1. unnecessarily permissive rights \n2. vulnerabilities in your cloud configuration.  \n3. odd changes in your infrastructure. \n\nIt is critical to make sure that visibility is satisfied, in order to enable threat discovery. \n\nFor example, [a graph that maps networks of cloud assets. identities and workloads](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) can help you properly understand relationships, properties, and types of assets in your cloud environment. \n\nVisually examining the characteristics of your infrastructure may aid you in taking the right measures to improve security. \n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Detect misconfigurations** \n\nAccording to [Continuity Central](https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/7117-misconfiguration-was-the-number-one-cause-of-cloud-security-incidents-in-2021), misconfigurations in the cloud environment were the main cause of cloud security breaches in 2021. It is easy to overlook: \n\n* a badly configured access list (ACL) \n* a bad policy for access control \n* an open port that should not be there, and others. \n\nHumans make mistakes. Even a minor misconfiguration that does not impact the activity in your cloud may lead to catastrophic events such as: \n\n* public access to your containers, \n* malware intrusion, \n* lateral movement.  \n\nDiscovering these mistakes before they are exploited is critical.  \n\nIdeally, you should have an automated way to check for common cloud misconfigurations. \n\nWe will provide you with a solution later in this article to easily keep misconfigurations under control and be notified when new ones appear. \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Implement remediation for findings** \n\nIt is not enough to only discover threats in your design. \n\nYou need to also be able to remediate the flaws in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nKnowing how to properly fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is a key factor in improving your cloud security. \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are: \n\n* restricting overly permissive access to users, \n* closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* blocking inbound & outbound traffic. \n\n<br/>\n\n**4. Ensure logging and monitoring** \n\nIt is very important to catch threats before they become incidents.  \n\nA good measure to take is keeping logs and documenting every event that occurs. \n\nIn this case, **targeted alerts** can save your company from disaster by pinpointing: \n\n* misconfigurations \n* suspicious activity \n* attacks coming from outside.  \n\nSpotting threats immediately or within a short period of time may save your cloud environment from being breached. \n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Assure compliance with international standards** \n\nMaking sure that your company is compliant with international standards such as [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/) not only consolidates your data protection services but also shows your clients that you acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity. \n\nFollowing [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) recommended by standards can greatly improve your cloud security posture. \n\nHowever, fulfilling all of the requirements consistently to become compliant with an international standard is a very tedious and time-consuming job. \n\nA solution to this would be automating controls and compliance checks that scan your platform for every requirement and show if you are fulfilling every request. \n\n<br/>\n\nWe have reached the end of the article and now you are probably wondering: \n\n**How do you implement all of the mentioned steps?** \n\nThe tasks described above can be implemented using a [CSPM product (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nCSPM is a component of cloud security that analyzes your cloud environment and alerts you on what controls are failing in your infrastructure. \n\nYour cloud security posture would be improved significantly and promptly when using a CSPM.  \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions to all of the problems raised in this article. \n\nWith Cyscale, you can: \n\n* get an overview of your assets and configurations, \n* easily manage misconfigurations, \n* receive targeted and precise alerts, \n* remediate accidents and flaws in your cloud environment faster, \n* become compliant with international standards. \n\nStart automating tasks, make these processes easier for you and generate reliable results, with [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","seoTitle":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","description":"When looking into consolidating your data protection services, you may decide to implement SOC 2 or ISO 27001.

Security\n\n   * Contains Security Incidents\n   * Communicates Remediation Activities\n2. Availability\n\n   * Identify environmental threats\n   * Measure Current Usage\n3. Processing Integrity\n\n   * Create and maintain records of system inputs\n   * Defines processing activities\n4. Confidentiality\n\n   * Identify confidential information\n   * Destroy confidential information\n5. Privacy\n\n   * Use clear and conspicuous language\n   * Collect information from reliable sources\n\n**For ISO 27001**, you need to:\n\n1. Implement an ISMS (Information Security Management Systems)\n2. Fulfill **7 requirements with 114 suggested controls** divided into 14 sections.\n\nThe requirements are described in the following clauses:\n\n* Clause 4: Context of the organization\n* Clause 5: Leadership\n* Clause 6: Planning\n* Clause 7: Support\n* Clause 8: Operation\n* Clause 9: Performance evaluation\n* Clause 10: Improvement\n\nIn the Annex of ISO 27001, you can find a list of controls and objectives to help you meet the requirements.\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/).\n\n**Price (of audit)**\n\n* For SOC 2, the cost depends on the type of audit and can range **between $5,000 and $60,000** with an average of about $20,000.\n* For ISO 27001, the price of an audit depends on the number of employees in the organization. It can go **as low as $5,400 up to $27,000**.\n\nIt is important to note that the price of implementing the standards may significantly increase the total cost of obtaining the accreditation.\n\nOne thing to note is that, although SOC 2 and ISO 27001 seem very different, their specifications overlap.\n\nThe level of similarity between the requirements of the two depends on:\n\n* The type of business you run\n* The scope of the audit\n\nThe similarity can be between 53% and 90%, according to AICPA’s mapping to ISO 27001.\n\nTaking into account all of the differences and similarities of the SOC 2 accreditation and the ISO 27001 certification, you can now choose the best standard for your company.\n\nFinally, implementing all the policies required by the described standards can be a difficult and time-consuming task.\n\nYou can make this process easier for you.\n\nWith [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can ensure easy and continuous compliance for ISO 27001.\n\nCyscale helps you meet the much-needed requirements described by this standard.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":63,"numPages":8,"currentPage":8,"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","seoTitle":"Sabrina Lupsan - Insights from a Cloud Security Analyst - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Discover how Sabrina Lupsan, a seasoned Cloud Security Analyst at Cyscale, integrates academic expertise and research to advance cloud security practices.","authorSlug":"sabrina-lupsan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
