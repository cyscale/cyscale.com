It builds upon the NIS 1 Directive, which regulates network and information systems security. NIS2 was created by the European Union to enforce a modern cybersecurity strategy, having in mind new sectors and improving incident response and resilience in compliant entities. NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) came into effect on the 16th of January 2023 and replaces NIS1, which was released in 2016. \n\n## Differences between NIS 1 and NIS 2 \n\nAiming to improve the NIS1 Directive, its newer version has a few differences. Some of the key ones are: \n\n* NIS2 now covers more sectors than NIS1, which focused on essential services operators in sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare. NIS2 also has cloud computing services in scope. Some examples of the newly added sectors are postal and courier services, waste management, digital providers. \n* Security controls are more stringent for NIS2. A few topics covered for the cloud are data encryption, IAM, vulnerability management, zero trust principles, and incident response. \n* Penalties no longer differ from country to country like they did in NIS1; they are harmonized across the European Union. \n\n## Key elements of NIS2 \n\nAll entities in scope should take measures to cover the most important elements, considered by NIS2 as the baseline for protecting the network, information systems, and physical environment from cybersecurity incidents. The following are the mandatory measures: \n\n* Policies on risk analysis and information system security, \n* Incident handling, \n* Business continuity, \n* Supply chain security, \n* Security in network and information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance, \n* Policies to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures, \n* Basic cyber hygiene practices and training, \n* Policies regarding the use of cryptography and encryption, \n* HR security, access control policies, access management, \n* The use of MFA or continuous authentication solutions. \n\nYou can find more details about these requirements directly from [the NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). \n\nThe NIS2 is crucial for implementing cybersecurity best practices and protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations can mitigate risks and contribute to a safer digital environment by adopting the mentioned requirements.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Meet NIS 2 compliance with Cyscale<span id=\"font-gradient\">Unified Cloud Security</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                See Demo\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Timeline and Deadlines\n\n* By **17 July 2024**, The European cyber crisis liaison organisation network (*EU-CyCLONe*) is required to submit its first report to the European Parliament and the Council, assessing its work.

Choosing the correct encryption algorithm, storing secrets in the right service, setting access to them; these are all actions that can make it or break it for your infrastructure.   \n\nIn this article, we will not only discuss how you should manage secrets in Kubernetes, but also help you understand why all these protection measures are vital for your Kubernetes clusters. \n\n## Secrets in Kubernetes \n\nSecrets are objects that contain keys, passwords, tokens. We're talking API keys, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, and others. Hackers dream of these every day and they put all their efforts into stealing them, so why wouldn’t you do the same, but for protecting them? \n\nHowever, even if they are the crown jewel of your Kubernetes cluster, they are actually stored unencrypted on etcd. That’s right. Anyone with access to etcd, as well as anyone with API access can retrieve (or even modify) a Secret. Moreover, [according to CNCF](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), anyone who is authorized to create a Pod in a namespace can also read any Secret in the namespace. So, we’ve already found two big problems: Secrets are stored unencrypted, and a lot of users can have access to them if you’re not implementing the Least Privilege Principle (which you can read more about [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)). Let’s see how to solve these issues. \n\n## Secrets Management Checklist \n\n### At rest encryption \n\nArguably the first step to securing secrets is encrypting them. At rest encryption ensures confidentiality. This means that if attackers get ahold of your secrets, they will not be able to read them unless they decrypt them. With [good key management and an appropriate cryptographic algorithm](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), you can keep attackers at bay. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo enable secret encryption at rest in EKS, you must: \n\n1. Navigate to the EKS console. You can click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters). \n2. Select the cluster for which you want to enable secret encryption. \n3. Under **Overview**, navigate to **Secrets Encryption** and select **Enable**. \n4. Choose a key from the drop-down list and select **Enable**. If you don’t already have a key, you must create one and return to this window. \n\nYou can also turn on secrets encryption for your Kubernetes clusters using this command: \n\n```html\naws eks associate-encryption-config --cluster-name <clusterName> --encryption-config '\\[{\"resources\":[\"secrets\"],\"provider\":{\"keyArn\":\"arn:aws:kms:<regionCode>:<account>:key/<key>\"}}]'\n```\n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo turn on KMS etcd encryption for an existing cluster, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <keyID>\n```\n\nThis enables secret encryption using a publicly reachable Azure Key Vault. It assumes you already have an encryption key and a managed identity configured to allow access to the key. [Our article](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/) explains more about Azure Key Vault and its configuration options. \n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nIn Google Cloud, Kubernetes secrets are encrypted at rest by default. However, you can turn on secrets encryption at the application layer. Here is how you can do it: \n\n1. Navigate to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console by clicking [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?_ga=2.113700551.1182343565.1709535826-1724752788.1707736657). \n2. Under **Security**, select the **Edit Application-layer Secrets Encryption** button. \n3. Select the **Enable Application-layer secrets encryption** checkbox and choose the key you want to use. \n4. Select **Save changes**. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\n1. **To begin the process of encrypting your secrets at rest**, generate an encryption key. You can use a Key Vault or a KMS to do this. Then, you need to create a configuration file. Here is an example provided by CNCF: \n\n```html\napiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1\nkind: EncryptionConfiguration\nresources:\n  - resources: null\n  - secrets\n  - configmaps\n  - pandas.awesome.bears.example\nproviders:\n  - aescbc:\n      keys: null\n  - name: key1\n    secret: <base64 encoded key>\n  - identity: {}\n```\n\nAfter you base64-encode it, add the key as the secret value. \n\n2. Save the configuration file to /etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml on the control plane node.  \n\nDon’t forget that your configuration file contains your key. Base64 encoding adds no security, so restrict permissions over the file as much as possible. \n\n3. Edit the manifest for the kube-apiserver static pod (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml) to contain the following command: *\\--encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml*. [Read more on the Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#write-an-encryption-configuration-file) website to see how to do this. \n\nAfter this, restart your API server to apply changes. After ensuring that all secrets are encrypted, remove the last line of the config file; “identity” allows for plaintext retrieval of secrets. \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Start to <span id=\"font-gradient\"> manage secrets </span> like a pro\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                See demo\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n### Key rotation \n\nKey management is just as important as the process of performing cryptographic operations. It doesn’t matter that your data is encrypted with the best encryption algorithm out there; if your key is leaked or stolen, an attacker can immediately decrypt your secret. So make sure to rotate your keys regularly to prevent data breaches. Let’s see how key rotation is handled in Kubernetes managed services and in self-managed clusters. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nIf you followed the previous steps and enabled EKS secret encryption with a KMS key, rotation is very easy to setup. Navigate to the KMS service, and under **Customer managed keys**, select the key you used. Under **Key rotation**, check the checkbox and click Save. The key will now be automatically rotated every eyar. \n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo rotate the key in a key vault, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <newKeyID>\n```\n\nRun the following command to re-encrypt secrets with the new key. \n\n```html\nkubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -\n```\n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to create a key, Cloud KMS sets the rotation period and next rotation time automatically. You can choose to use the default values or specify different values. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\nThese are the steps to rotate your decryption key, according to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/): \n\n1. Generate a new key securely and add it as the second entry for the current provider on all control plane nodes. Restart all kube-apiserver processes so that each server can decrypt data encrypted with the new key. \n2. Backup the new encryption key. If you lose it, you lose access to all data encrypted with it.  \n3. Make the new key the first entry in the keys array and restart all kube-apiserver processes. \n4. Run *kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -* to encrypt all secrets with the new key. \n5. Remove the old key from the configuration. \n\n### RBAC and the Least Privilege Principle \n\nNow that we’ve taken care of at-rest encryption, let’s see how to assign permissions to users securely.  \n\nTo manage permissions for secrets and for other Kubernetes objects, we recommend using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). RBAC allows you to assign fine-grained permissions with which users or groups of users can perform certain operations (such as create, read, update, or delete) on Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, services, etc. \n\n**Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings**  \n\nRoles and ClusterRoles are two kinds of Kubernetes objects that describe the permissions users are given if they have that role. The basic Role sets the permissions over an object or a set of objects within a specific namespace, while the ClusterRole spans across all namespaces of the cluster. Below, you can see an example of a Role: \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: default\n  name: pod-reader\nrules:\n  - apiGroups:\n      - ''\n    resources:\n      - pods\n    verbs:\n      - get\n      - watch\n      - list\n```\n\nA ClusterRole would simply have “kind: ClusterRole”, and no namespace specified. \n\nNotice how this is a role definition and not a policy; it’s not assigned to any user or group of users. Here come into play RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings. These objects form the relation between a role and a user or a group of users. RoleBindings grants the permissions defined in the Role object, and ClusterRoleBindings binds ClusterRoles to users or groups across the entire Kubernetes cluster. \n\nYou can also reference a ClusterRole in a RoleBinding! This way lets you define a set of common rules across your entire cluster, ensuring consistency across namespaces. Be careful though to not grant users more permissions than necessary by using the ClusterRole. \n\n[This is an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#restrictions-on-role-creation-or-update) of a ClusterRole, assigned to the user “dave” in the “development” namespace using a RoleBinding. \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-secrets\n  namespace: development\nsubjects:\n  - kind: User\n    name: dave\n    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: secret-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\nAlways remember to assign the minimum permissions necessary. This minimizes the attack surface and prevents privilege escalation in case one of your pods or users is compromised. To follow the Least Privilege Principle and protect your secrets, keep in mind the following best practices for Kubernetes: \n\n* Assign only the specific permissions you want a user to have. Instead of using wildcard (*) permissions, which may result in overly privileged roles, specify the verbs of the actions they’re allowed to perform, \n* Assign roles at the namespace-level rather than at cluster-level, to give users privileges only for the namespaces they use, \n* Perform regular access reviews to ensure everything is functioning correctly and users are not accessing resources they shouldn’t, \n* Monitor your Kubernetes cluster constantly to identify suspicious behaviour. \n\n### **Centralized Secrets Store providers** \n\nBy using a cloud Secrets Store solution, you can centralize secrets management and leave the storage, auditing, logging to the cloud provider. Moreover, if you integrate your Kubernetes cluster within the cloud using a managed solution (like EKS, AKS, GKE), you obtain a unified infrastructure. \n\nTo understand how much better Secrets Stores are, let’s look at the available solutions on the market.  \n\n**AWS Secrets Manager** is a centralized and secure solution for storing, managing, and rotating secrets. It offers fine-grained access control using AWS IAM, automatic rotation of secrets, secure storage, and monitoring capabilities. It is integrated with Kubernetes, allowing you to access secrets at runtime. AWS Secrets Manager keeps secrets encrypted at rest and sends them securely over SSL. \n\nBy using a managed solution, the pressure on developers decreases, allowing them to focus on their tasks. \n\n**Azure Key Vault** is a Secrets Store for secrets, cryptographic keys and certificates. It has advanced safety and recovery options, two permission models, and data plane and control plane separation. You can read more about Azure Key Vault [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/). Azure Key Vault integrates seamlessly with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure services. \n\n**Google Cloud Secret Manager** is Google Cloud’s version for storing secrets securely. Google Cloud Secret Manager offers a fully managed solution for storing and managing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. It provides versioning, access controls, and audit logging capabilities, ensuring the secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information. \n\nUsing the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) for Kubernetes secrets, Secrets stored in managed stores in the cloud can be treated as files mounted in Kubernetes pods, allowing for a seamless utilization of secrets with no added complexity but with maximum security. \n\nManaging secrets in Kubernetes is a critical aspect of securing your Kubernetes cluster. In this article, we’ve discussed secrets encryption at rest, RBAC, and managed Secrets Store solutions in the cloud. \n\nImplementing a comprehensive secrets management strategy is a difficult task, but one that you should not work on alone.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

It’s not always by choice \n\nA multi-cloud strategy can combine the best of two (or more!) worlds, allowing cloud-native organizations to choose best-of-breed options for building apps and storing data in the cloud. At least this is true when the multi-cloud approach is by design.  \n\nIt’s not unheard of for a multi-cloud approach to happen by accident. Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security","CNAPP"],"title":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Data Plane vs. Management Plane, Access Roles and More","seoTitle":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Access Roles and More","description":"Azure Key Vault securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services.

And while it’s your safest bet to keep your crypto keys, certificates, and other secrets safe, it can become your worst enemy if you don’t manage it correctly. \n\n## What is Azure Key Vault? \n\nBefore we begin looking at best practices and security features of Key Vault, let’s go over the basics. \n\nAzure Key Vault is a Microsoft Azure product that securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services. It also allows users to manage a key's lifecycle, from key generation to destruction. \n\n*Did you know that if you create a key in a Key Vault, you can never actually see it? This is to safeguard against a human leaking the key. This also applies to imported keys.* \n\nAzure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard and Premium. The only difference between them is that Premium allows HSM protection for keys. HSM (Hardware Security Module) provides hardware security on top of the software security supplied by Azure as a fully managed, single tenant, premium safeguard. This is the most stringent security measure that can be applied to crypto keys. \n\n## Access control management in Azure Key Vault \n\nKey Vault authorization is done on two different planes: \n\n* The management plane, which allows users to delete key vaults, update access policies, and see properties, and \n* The data plane, where Key Vault objects can be added, deleted and modified. \n\nBasically, if you have access to the management plane, you can modify the cloud resource but have no access to the actual data in it. The opposite goes for the data plane, where you can make operations on the secrets, keys, and certificates but cannot, for example, add or remove access policies. You can delete a key, but not the actual key vault. \n\nNow that we know the difference between the two planes, let's look at some of the most used built-in RBAC roles for Key Vaults. Remember that Role Base Access Controls (RBAC) are used to restrict access to the network based on the user’s role. \n\n*Authorization for the data plane can be done using Azure Key Vault access policies as well as RBAC roles, but for the management plane, only RBAC roles can be used. Access policies are now considered legacy, and we recommend using RBAC.* \n\nAnd while access control policies help you define fine-grained control over objects and resources, this is not the way to go anymore. Policies are not a centralized management solution, meaning that you can’t just see and change permissions in one place; you would have to check each policy to see what a user's effective permissions are. Moreover, removing permissions can be difficult; the user no longer needs access to keys? Instead of going over one or more policies and unchecking the boxes that give them access, you can just remove their Key Vault Crypto Officer role, and you’re done! That way you don’t risk forgetting about a policy in the process. \n\nTo transition from access policies to RBAC, assess current permissions for all users, change to an RBAC permission model, establish the correct roles for them (and follow the Least Privilege Principle), assign those roles, and thoroughly test the setup. And to know which Key Vault Roles to use, keep reading this article! \n\n## Roles in Azure Key Vault \n\nManaging access control correctly and using the appropriate role for the job is good practice for cloud security. Following the Least Privilege Principle and only providing the necessary permissions are the keys to minimizing attack surfaces and giving your cloud environment the best chance against attackers. \n\nLet’s look at some of the available built-in Key Vault roles provided by Microsoft Azure. Remember that these roles only work if you've set Azure RBAC as the permission model (which is recommended). \n\n1. **Key Vault Reader**: This role provides the user with permission to read metadata of key vaults and their objects (certificates, keys, secrets). \n2. **Key Vault Administrator**: As an Administrator, you have all data plane permissions on all types of objects. \n3. **Key Vault Secrets Officer, Key Vault Certificates Officer, Key Vault Crypto Officer**: These three roles allow users to perform all actions on the type of Key Vault object the role is for, except managing permissions. So, a Key Vault Certificates Officer would have permissions on certificates, and so on. \n4. **Key Vault Secrets User, Key Vault Crypto User**: These roles are similar to the previous one but have fewer permissions. The Secrets user can see the secret contents. The Crypto user can perform cryptographic operations using the keys stored in the Key Vault. *Notice how there’s no Key Vault Certificates User? The Secrets user can also read the secret portion of a certificate with a private key, so apps use this role to retrieve certificates.* \n\nKeep in mind that users who can manage permissions over the Key Vault can grant themselves data plane permissions by modifying the access policies, so this plane segregation only goes so far. For this reason, I will once again remind you – follow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)! Don't give users more permissions than the bare minimum they need to do their job.  \n\nExcess privileges can be a gateway to disaster.  \n\n## Safety and recovery features in Azure Key Vault \n\nAzure Key Vault has a very useful feature called **soft-delete**. This allows for Key Vaults and Key Vault objects to remain recoverable for a period of 7 to 90 days (if no period is specified, then the default is set to 90). So, if someone accidentally deletes something, it can still be recovered within that timeframe. \n\n*Soft-delete is set to Enabled by default for new Key Vaults, and if a Key Vault has soft-delete enabled, it can never be disabled.* By design, Azure Key Vault makes it hard for users to lose their keys! \n\nBesides soft-delete, there’s also **purge protection**. This is another safety feature that goes beyond soft-delete, by preventing accidental **permanent** deletion. If you want to protect your Azure Key Vault from deletion while it is in its soft-deleted state, it ensures that no-one can delete it before the soft-delete period is over. **Once purge protection is enabled, just like soft-delete, it cannot be disabled.**  \n\nTo purge a Key Vault or a Key Vault object, you must have special permissions that are not, by default, given to any role. *The argument –enable-purge-protection can also be set to true to prevent anyone from purging a resource.*  \n\nIf this sounds all complicated, we can sum it up easily: once you delete a soft-delete-enabled Key Vault resource, it goes into the soft-delete state for a set period. If you also have purge protection enabled, you can't force delete it before that period is up. It's a layered protection model; you must go through multiple steps to delete a resource, making it as fool-proof as possible.  \n\nIn terms of backup, Azure recommends that you only backup secrets that are business critical; due to the nature of Key Vaults, the objects stored in them are already ensured availability: “Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically failover requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user”.  \n\nYou also can't back up your vault. It can be an annoyance, but you must back up each object and then restore them one by one. To do this, you download a blob containing the secret in an encrypted form, which you can then upload back in your Azure Key Vault. You have to upload it back in the same subscription to be able to use it (and, of course, in Azure Key Vault, not somewhere else). \n\n## Logging and protection in Azure Key Vault \n\nBesides following the best practices described in this article, you can also enable **Microsoft Defender for Key Vault**. This enables: \n\n* threat detection,  \n* threat intelligence,  \n* anomaly detection, and  \n* behavior analytics. \n\nAlso, don't forget about logging! Ensure to log user activity to identify suspicious behavior and obtain an audit trail to identify who accessed Key Vaults and when. \n\nYou can find all of these best practices and more in the Cyscale app, where we highlight misconfigurations and give you step-by-step instructions on configuring Azure Key Vaults correctly and keeping your secrets safe. \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"The Cloud Compliance Landscape in 2024: DORA, CIS, and More","seoTitle":"The Cloud Compliance Landscape in 2024: DORA, CIS, and More","description":"What are the regulatory changes in 2024 to ensure continued compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for DORA?","seoDescription":"What are the regulatory changes in 2024 to ensure continued compliance with PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for DORA?","date":"2024-01-24T14:28:56.143Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cloud-compliance-2024-dora-cis","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/d6cae/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png","srcSet":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/ac644/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 205w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/89b47/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 410w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/d6cae/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/913d0/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 205w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/91660/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 410w,\n/static/dc53ac7e558c823a522ffae0c087148a/888e2/29_blog-cloud-and-compliance.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"Keeping track of changing requirements in compliance standards and laws is a time-consuming job that quickly becomes overwhelming given the volume of updates and new benchmarks affecting broad and niche business sectors.  \n\nThis article is a compilation of changes businesses should be aware of in 2024, so they can ensure continued compliance with the most well-known regulatory frameworks, such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, and prepare for incoming regulations such as DORA. \n\n## DORA: Incoming \n\nDORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) comes into power on the 17th of January 2025, and it’s a big one because it will affect everybody in the financial sector, not just banks. So affected companies should be spending a good amount of time in 2024 planning and preparing.  \n\nDORA is an EU regulatory standard for financial institutions with activity in the European Union, but it also applies to entities outside of the EU which provide ICT services to financial entities within the EU. \n\nEssentially, the regulation seeks to ensure that financial services firms and institutions can recover and get back up and running quickly after a security incident. The aim is to minimize the impact on customers and consumers.   \n\nThe focus is on harmonizing internal processes while strengthening transparency and the monitoring of third-party service providers such as cloud services platforms. It’s really all about context and being able to see technological connections across the entire business and understanding how and where there are vulnerabilities. Ultimately this helps to ensure not just the continuity of service delivery, but also the business’s ability to keep making money. \n\nThis has led observers to note that DORA could become a template to be adopted by other regulatory models. In fact, [a recent report from PWC](https://www.pwc.lu/en/digital-operational-resilience-act/dora-what-matters-now-for-your-business-resilience.html) proposes that instead of seeing DORA “as a mere compliance matter, financial entities should view it as an opportunity to enhance their digital operational resilience and proactively ready themselves for upcoming regulations pertaining to other facets of the digital realm, namely Artificial Intelligence.” \n\nWe have [a detailed article on DORA](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) that you can check out for more information and for a list of requirements related to cloud security and operational risk management. \n\n## CIS Benchmarks: Updated \n\n[CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) are configuration recommendations for more than 25 vendor product families, and they receive regular updates every year. Here are the latest versions for the most important CIS Benchmarks related to the cloud: \n\n* [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/azure). The previous version, v1.5.0., was released in August 2022. The latest version appeared in February of 2023.  \n* [CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services) appeared in June of 2023, and was previously released in August of 2022. \n* [Google Cloud](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform) [Platform 1.3.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform) was previously updated in 2022.  \n* [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.8.0](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes). The newest version was released at the end of September 2023.  \n\nCIS updates usually contain anything from additional requirements to text revisions and removing deprecated recommendations. These standards are highly regarded and very useful, and we recommend using them when planning your cloud security strategy for 2024 and beyond.  \n\n## PCI-DSS: March 2024 deadline \n\n2024 is a big year for compliance across many industries, especially those that deal with financial information. PCI-DSS, which relates to the processing and storing of credit card data, saw its latest version, 4.0, emerge in March of 2022.  \n\nThe regulation allowed companies a transition period of two years due to its extensive changes, meaning the clock is ticking down to end-March this year. While companies still have a little time to become accredited for version 4.0, compliance with version 3.2.0 is still required in the meantime. \n\n[PCI-DSS v4.0](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-version-4/) has many additional requirements in all categories, regulating logging and monitoring, authentication, vulnerability scanning, and many others. This is why it makes sense why the PCI SSC (The PCI Security Standards Council) has granted companies two years to become compliant. \n\nFor instructions on implementing the requirements using Cyscale controls, [this guide has all the steps you need](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/).  \n\n## NIST: Version 2.0 arrives \n\nThe long-awaited [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/29/the-nist-cybersecurity-framework-20/ipd) will be out this year, and we're excited about it! NIST released the first version of the framework in 2014 and later in 2018 updated it into what it is now – version 1.1. It's been five years – a long time coming.  \n\nIn 2023 multiple drafts have been released, and the CSF is expected to be ready in early 2024. \n\n<img src=\"/img/csf-timeline.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"  style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\nSource: <https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/updating-nist-cybersecurity-framework-journey-csf-20>, Credit: Kristina Rigopoulos \n\n[According to NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/just-released-nist-csf-2-0-reference-tool), the new version will set out to: \n\n* expand the current scope, \n* add a sixth function, Govern, which covers decision-making around cybersecurity in terms of people, processes, and technology, and relates to the five other functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover (to read about the other functions, read [our detailed article on NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/)), \n* improve the guidance on implementing the CSF. \n\n## HITRUST: Setting the standard in healthcare \n\nThe most recent version of [HITRUST](https://cyscale.com/blog/hitrust-compliance-in-the-cloud/) (11.2.0) was released in November of 2023. It contains 14 control categories, divided into 49 objectives with 156 control references. Control references are requirements and best practices.  \n\nHITRUST is a framework for securing and managing information in the healthcare industry. This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. Let’s just say it’s [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/)’s big sister, with a whopping 516 pages that seem very intimidating in terms of implementation, but with benefits in terms of credibility and assurance that are not to be underestimated. \n\n## 2024: A busy year for cloud compliance professionals  \n\nAs is now typical, 2024 is going to be another busy year for compliance. As adoption of the cloud grows, so do the rules and regulations governing its usage. Along with the updates to standards listed above, we cannot ignore the steps taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, pushing for US companies to disclose cybersecurity incidents they experience along with material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.  \n\nOther regions should take note because the SEC also adopted rules requiring foreign private issuers to make comparable disclosures. We are likely to see more regulatory developments that put CISOs and other security and compliance leaders [in the spotlight of responsibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/).  \n\n#### M﻿anage your cloud compliance posture\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/compliance-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\nFind out how Cyscale can help you keep up with the continuous changes in the cybersecurity landscape and achieve (and maintain) compliance with less stress. Cyscale provides support for all of the frameworks mentioned in this article, as well as ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, MAS TRM, and more. \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">LEARN MORE</button></a></div>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP Buyer’s Guide: How to Secure Your Cloud-Native Applications","seoTitle":"CNAPP Buyer’s Guide: How to Secure Your Cloud-Native Apps","description":"Cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)","seoDescription":"Cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)","date":"2024-01-15T10:44:50.878Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cnapp-buyers-guide-secure-cloud-native-apps","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/2c0f5/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/41be8/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.jpg 205w,\n/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/c78f7/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.jpg 410w,\n/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/2c0f5/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/913d0/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.webp 205w,\n/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/91660/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.webp 410w,\n/static/3538218607b5a35ecf830f79d543522b/888e2/cnapp-buyers-guide-cover.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"With the transition to the cloud, application architectures have shifted to make use of new technologies such as containers, Kubernetes, and serverless. But while these developments have made it easier than ever to deploy applications, they have dramatically changed the landscape in terms of security.   \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture to traditional non-native applications, it is essential to understand how the key features of cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns and are driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) as a result.  \n\n## How is cloud-native infrastructure different?  \n\nCloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes. Cloud-native applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). \n\nThese technologies significantly increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but they introduce new concerns in terms of security along with a much larger attack surface area.   \n\n## What is a CNAPP? \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP is becoming a necessary solution to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.   \n\nCoined by Gartner, [cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are described as a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.  \n\nOne of the key features being that CNAPPs consolidate several previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), runtime cloud workload protection and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning, into one solution. \n\nThis guide will help you understand the most important features of a CNAPP that secure cloud-native applications and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:   \n\n* [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) (Cloud Security Posture Management)   \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)  \n* [CIEM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iam-security/) (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management)  \n* [KSPM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/kubernetes-security-platform/) (Kubernetes Security Posture Management)  \n* Container Security \n\n**G﻿et an overview of CNAPP capabilities**\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/Cyscale-explainer-video-2023-12-Dec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n## Visibility of cloud-native infrastructure \n\nWhereas traditional environments relied largely on proprietary software, isolated hardware, and almost total control of the stack, cloud-native environments may stretch across multiple clouds, make use of open-source code, require identity-based segmentation, and feature ephemeral workloads.   \n\nAs a result, context-aware visibility of all these assets and resources is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Not only is the surface area for attack dramatically increased, you also need to determine whether a vulnerability in one resource is innocuous or if it creates a toxic combination through its relationship with other assets.   \n\nA misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access and serve as a jumping-off point to more resources, for example.   \n\nTherefore, the visibility features found in CSPM solutions are incorporated into CNAPP to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. Usually, visibility comes in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can illustrate current security scores, assets that need your attention, and other elements that may help you understand your cloud. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see all your cloud resources in one place, so as to be constantly aware of your cloud environment? \n* Does it provide full coverage and visibility into your cloud estate and risks, including cloud configuration, workload, and identity? \n* Does it bring your multi-cloud infrastructure together in one tool and deliver risk-aware context? \n* Does it identify assets that might or have drifted from your organization’s compliance baseline? \n\n## Cloud-native security controls  \n\nManually going through every cloud asset configuration to check for issues and vulnerabilities is tedious and error prone in smaller estates and impossible in large cloud environments where thousands of assets are in use. Don’t forget that the approach for AWS is different to that of Azure, is different to Google Cloud, and different again with Kubernetes.   \n\nA certified expert in one environment does not equal transferable skills to another.  \n\nTo solve these challenges, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and either automate the remediation of or provide guidance to address issues. The application of automation, using Machine Learning and AI, not only saves considerable time but reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP provide contextual triaging and prioritization or send targeted alerts for high-priority assets to reduce and relieve alert fatigue? \n* Does it detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, enabling you to react and fix findings quickly, saving your organization from a breach? \n* Does it deliver efficient remediation steps on detected issues? \n\n## Data security in the cloud \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications with ephemeral workloads and infrastructure that is scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be unwittingly exposed. Through DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, CNAPPs can help keep track of data stores and provide actionable suggestions for your organization to secure your crown jewels. \n\nA CNAPP will detect and highlight unencrypted storage resources, cryptographic keys with insecure configurations or upcoming expirations, assets that are publicly accessible, and other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may leave your organization’s sensitive data exposed.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Are the Data Security Dashboard capabilities of the CNAPP capable of pinpointing blind spots in your infrastructure? \n* Some cloud providers encrypt data in storage resources by default, while others do not so it is easy to overlook what you think you know and miss important details. Does the CNAPP help you understand your encryption status? \n* Instead of dealing with cryptographic key rotation and deletion, some CNAPPs show you what keys need to be rotated and when. Does the CNAPP provide this capability? \n\n## Container image scanning   \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.   \n\nRetroactively, a CNAPP can identify which container images have vulnerabilities and where those images are running in your infrastructure. \n\nFor example, if a container image uses an unpatched version of Log4J, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications in that container.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP check container images for vulnerabilities to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your infrastructure? \n* Does the CNAPP help you understand who has permissions over containers to prevent unauthorized access? \n* Are you able to monitor for and identify any misconfigurations developers might have missed when spinning up containers? \n\n## Cloud workloads protection  \n\nThe Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) component of a CNAPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in CVEs and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them.  \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes:  \n\n* VMs \n* Containers  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see running workloads in one dashboard to easily keep you up to date with your organization’s activity all the time? \n* Does it help you prioritize vulnerable workloads efficiently based on severity to ensure effective remediation measures? \n* Does it automatically keep up with emerging threats, so you don’t have to check the news all the time? Your CNAPP should do the work for you by constantly checking your workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\n## Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior.  \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are:  \n\n* Unauthorized access   \n* Missing patches   \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP give you visibility of your Kubernetes objects? \n* Does it help you assess your cluster based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark, which contains up-to-date and industry-standard best practices? \n* Does it detect vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster with no need for manual effort from your team? You should be able to see where you have Kubernetes images with vulnerabilities and where those images are deployed.  \n\n## CIEM and IAM: Access management   \n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is an essential component of cloud-native applications security specific to the CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) part of the platform. With complex cloud environments, keeping track of users and services, their different access levels, and what impact certain permissions have can become challenging.  \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to, but not limited to, the following aspects:  \n\n* Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making them more difficult to manage  \n* Cloud-native software may run across multi-cloud environments as well as on-premises  \n* The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing identities at the service level \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to better secure their cloud in terms of identity and access management.   \n\n## Best practices regarding IAM:  \n\n* Implement multi-factor authentication for all users. This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification  \n* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity  \n* Comply with the Least Privilege Principle to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary for the user to do their job  \n* Assign permissions at group level and assign well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP identify any drifts from your company’s security or compliance posture using a powerful IAM dashboard that pinpoints users with issues, such as the ones that do not have MFA enabled? \n* Does the CNAPP give you an understanding of your password policies and identify if users have old passwords? \n* Does it help you understand if users or groups have more permissions than necessary? \n* Does the CNAPP support you in performing effective access reviews that don’t take all day and require no manual work? \n* Does it help you gain confidence in your organization’s security posture? \n\n## Compliance  \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their compliance journey. The CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet the requirements of various compliance frameworks.   \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to perform assessments in preparation for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards a CNAPP should provide support for are are:  \n\n* ISO 27001   \n* SOC 2  \n* GDPR  \n* PCI-DSS  \n* HIPAA  \n* NIST \n\nOther standards like DORA are becoming increasingly important for some sectors, and there are regional equivalents of some regulations like Brazil’s LGDP data protection laws. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP help you track your compliance progress in real-time and ensure you are able to understand how your organization is doing in terms of compliance posture? \n* Does the CNAPP keep a track record of your efforts that can be presented during an audit? \n* Are all of your organization's cloud resources tracked in one place, so you know that the compliance assessment is comprehensive and accurate and you're not missing anything? \n* Can you view your compliance score at-a-glance and at any time? \n* Are you able to export detailed reports to help explain your security and compliance posture to other stakeholders or to help you make a case to the board? \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/full-platform-tour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">TAKE A TOUR OF CYSCALE'S CNAPP</button></a></div>\n\n## Summary: CNAPP as a critical part of cloud-native security \n\nAs cloud-native application development has penetrated the market, it has not only expanded the infrastructure estate but also the number of teams involved, from devops, to platform engineers, cloud architects, security experts, compliance practitioners, and more.  \n\nLikewise, security solutions have evolved in tandem, moving beyond the more static nature of the CSPM, to the more dynamic capabilities of a CNAPP, with an integrated, lifecycle security and compliance approach to protecting workloads and applications. \n\nThe vendor landscape is competitive and vendor portfolios have either grown through acquisition or original development. The result is that many established vendor CNAPP offerings are bolted together point solutions with little or no integration.  \n\nCloud-native organizations going down this route will need to ensure they have the resources available to learn and operate several different tools and even take on some of the work around correlation and context in cloud security.  \n\nThe main concern with challenger or incoming CNAPP vendors, on the other hand, might be a lack of maturity in the components, even though the platform itself is designed with integration in mind.  \n\nOrganizations will need to carefully assess the capabilities of the CNAPP solution to ensure it meets their specific needs, without requiring too many resources or investments, and with room for future growth.  \n\nThat said, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are regarded as a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, its high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient.  \n\n### C﻿hoosing a CNAPP\n\n**Overall, CNAPP solutions offer:**  \n\n1. Visibility  \n2. Compliance  \n3. Data security  \n4. Runtime protection  \n5. Container image scanning  \n6. Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n7. IAM  \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) is designed to protect your entire stack, VMs (virtual machines), containers, and serverless, on any cloud environment, enabling you to confidently accelerate innovation. \n\nBy analyzing cloud configuration, workload, and identity, it identifies the most critical attack vectors that pose a threat, rather than overwhelming you with numerous alerts for vulnerabilities, permissions, and exposed services. \n\nWith our security platform, you can prioritize and address the most significant security risks, ensuring application security and the integrity of your cloud infrastructure. \n\nYou can sign up for a [no commitment cloud risk assessment here](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/), and check the health of your cloud estate in a matter of minutes.  \n\nOr explore each of the components that make up an [effective CNAPP in our video tours](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/), here.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id=\"cta-image\" data-ignore=\"true\">\n</a>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges in 2024","seoTitle":"Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges in 2024 | Cyscale ","description":"Understand the top 10 cloud security challenges, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, and learn how to build a roadmap to a secure cloud.

But this year it’s different. \n\nThe rapid and unpredictable rise of AI has drawn attention through all of 2023, leading to questions about the positive and negative impact it will have on lives and businesses going forward.  \n\nThere’s no doubt AI-driven attacks will be a pivotal challenge that defines the cloud security landscape for 2024, but it’s not the only consideration characterized by intricate and cutting-edge vulnerabilities and attacks. \n\nLet's take a close look at the top 10 cloud security challenges we've identified in the last year that need to be closely monitored in 2024 and beyond. \n\n# 1. Advanced AI-driven threats \n\nThroughout 2023, AI exploded as a megatrend that changes the risk landscape significantly – both positively and negatively. We’ve seen AI-powered DDoS attacks, where attackers use automation to adjust threat vectors based on real-time analysis of success against various attack surfaces, and ransomware and malware that can adapt to the environment and replicate using existing and newly discovered vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe potential for generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is a double-edged sword, and the cloud security landscape feels uncertain as attackers come up with more and more sophisticated attacks. \n\nIn 2023, hackers managed to abuse the growing popularity of OpenAI's well-known tool, ChatGPT. [The chatbot was found to be \"hallucinating\"](https://vulcan.io/blog/ai-hallucinations-package-risk) in its responses to questions about coding packages and libraries and recommending things that didn't exist.  \n\nHackers went ahead and created malicious packages with the same names, so developers receiving the same recommendations from ChatGPT would download the malicious software. \n\nAlthough the threat is of great concern, it’s not all doom and gloom, according to Google Cloud’s own CISO. While it’s true we expect to see AI help attackers, AI should also give defenders a [significant advantage because AI is good at amplifying capability based on data](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/cloud-ciso-perspectives-how-the-ai-megatrend-can-help-manage-threats-reduce-toil-and-scale-talent) — and defenders have more data. \n\n## Protecting against AI-driven threats \n\nIn this rapidly changing field, continuous education regarding emerging AI-threats is vital. Awareness campaigns and training are the best weapons against these kinds of attacks. \n\nCloud security solutions such as [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) are also leading the application of AI to make cybersecurity more human friendly. As security practitioners are overwhelmed by information, making sense of that information in terms of context and inference is becoming more of a challenge.  \n\n Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant is a move towards making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\nOur platform can [automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues](https://cyscale.com/blog/introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant/) using the specific customers’ cloud footprint combined with LLMs of vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image' data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n</a>\n\n# 2. Phishing and Social Engineering \n\nHuman behavior remains one of the staples in any list of risks, both as an external threat as well as an internal one due to disgruntled employees.  \n\nAs an external threat, phishing is still one of the most effective attacks. Humans are always the weak link in the security chain, and AI is making defending from social engineering attacks even harder due to the ease with which deep fakes can be produced that appear to be someone you know, to automated, convincing emails, messages, and chats with no grammar errors or that take on the tone and style of a specific person. \n\nIn the cloud, [IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) (Identity and Access Management) is the first line of defense when focusing on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets. \n\nLeaked credentials and bypassed authentication processes are very dangerous and can lead to massive disasters, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive resources. \n\n## Protecting against phishing and social engineering attacks \n\nTraining programs for social engineering attacks are necessary to prevent employees from falling for phishing scams.  \n\nEnforcing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is essential. Whether you’re using a passwordless solution or passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone and especially for high-privilege users.   \n\n# 3. Evolving regulatory frameworks \n\nAs technology advances, we see more and more updates and additions to [compliance laws and standards](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-compliance-101-basics-best-practices/) ensuring both businesses and customer data are adequately protected.  \n\nMaintaining compliance with the increasing complexity of frameworks and benchmarks can become overwhelming very quickly, especially for small teams.  \n\nFor example, in 2023, we saw multiple [updates to CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) for cloud services including Azure, AWS, and Kubernetes.  \n\nFor financial institutions, the implementation deadline for [DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)](https://cyscale.com/blog/dora-compliance-in-the-cloud/) is also quickly approaching, with the release scheduled for early 2025 (17th of January). \n\nAll told, 2024 is a pivotal year for compliance and companies must keep up with the evolving regulations and maintain a good cloud security posture to protect themselves from emerging cybersecurity threats. \n\n## Maintaining compliance with cloud security regulations and standards \n\nBecause of the ever-changing landscape, staying on top of cloud security compliance is a continuous process that involves regular assessments of your cloud estate and compliance posture.  \n\nYou can keep up to date on new and changing requirements by [reading our blog posts.](https://cyscale.com/blog/compliance/) Furthermore, cloud security solutions like [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) can also help you keep track of your compliance progress and know where you’re standing. \n\n# 4. Quantum computing for password cracking \n\nWidely used encryption algorithms such as RSA were originally designed to withstand traditional computing attack methods, requiring a significant amount of computations to be made in order to crack passwords.  \n\nThe entire cryptographic landscape is currently based on this solution, with RSA protecting sensitive data everywhere. But developments in quantum computing keep advancing and threaten to make the impossible number of computations achievable.  \n\nAs a result, it’s expected that traditional encryption methods might one day become obsolete. The day quantum computing attacks will become possible is named Q-day, and it might be around the corner. \n\n## Protecting against quantum computing attacks \n\nIn parallel with developments in quantum computing, [quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms) or post-quantum cryptography are our only solutions at this time, and the first group of encryption tools that are designed to withstand the assault of a future quantum computer are in development.   \n\n# 5. Complexity in multi-cloud environments \n\nIt’s often said that the real killer in cloud security is the complexity. Cloud platforms and products have evolved in a granular fashion and security has followed suit. One often quoted Gartner prediction is that 99% of cloud security failures through 2025 will be due to user error as admins struggle to keep control of sprawling estates.\n\nCloud service providers offer menus of products and services running into the hundreds, each with their own security configuration, and in a multi-cloud environment this complexity is amplified.  \n\nManaging data security in multi-cloud environments can be especially challenging due to cloud providers' different configurations, security policies, even their vocabulary. As new tools appear, fully understanding a multi-cloud infrastructure can become harder. Remember, a certified AWS cloud expert is not an Azure cloud expert by default, and vice versa.   \n\n## Reducing complexity in multi-cloud environments\n\nBringing all your cloud assets, information, and configurations into one single platform is the key to not getting lost in your own cloud, and this means adopting a security strategy that includes a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) or a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) solution.   \n\nGartner research found that CSPM implementations can reduce cloud security incidents caused by misconfigurations by up to 80%. The single-pane-of-glass view across your multi-cloud estate also cuts down on the need to switch between multiple dashboards and means you can understand your entire cloud inventory in context.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/inventory-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 6. Cybersecurity alert fatigue \n\nStress and burnout are rampant among cybersecurity professionals and the impact of [user fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/) is no secret - thousands of alerts and logs that signal everything and anything that happens in the cloud is not a helpful approach. In many cloud security setups, the default process is to alert for every event, regardless of its criticality.  \n\nThis flood of alerts can quickly become overwhelming for cloud security professionals who become used to severe or critical alerts popping up every day. When everything is critical, nothing is. So, this can desensitize them, and when an actual breach occurs and legitimately critical alerts are sent out, they can end up being overlooked. \n\nThis approach can also turn into a resource hog, giving security practitioners an endless list of tasks to work through that might not achieve the desired results.  \n\n## Protecting against alert fatigue \n\nTo prevent user fatigue, contextual security is the best approach and your ability to prioritize remediation work efficiently depends on the capabilities of your [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) or [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nBy filtering out alerts that are not actually high risk in your unique cloud environment and shifting focus to your own most sensitive cloud resources, you can help your security people work more effectively.  \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/alerts-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 7. Executive decisions and responsibilities \n\nOne of the biggest challenges a CISO or CTO faces when approaching the board or C suite for funding is justifying their cybersecurity spend. There has long been a perception gap between the cost of security versus the cost of a breach and the simple truth is, you can spend some money up front to reduce the likelihood of a breach, or you can spend more later when the breach has happened.  \n\nThe [global average cost of a data breach has climbed 15% over the last three years](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs) and with lagging investment, only about one third of breaches are picked up by an organization’s own team.  \n\nFurthermore, we’ve seen how decisions made by individuals in executive positions make or break a company through their impact on the company's security strategy. Look at the [SolarWinds case](https://cyscale.com/blog/sec-charges-solarwinds-ciso-for-fraud/) as an example, where the SolarWinds CISO ended up being investigated for fraud over failure to fully disclose security gaps and issues in the company. \n\nThere’s also the issue of how those responsible for executing on the security strategy are impacted by executive decisions. The SEC investigation into SolarWinds found that “the volume of security issues being identified have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”   \n\n## Empowering security leaders to be effective \n\nAs increasing board liability for risk is sinking in, CTOs, CISOs, and security leaders should be looking to justify their security spend by aligning it with business goals, and instead of operating in a vacuum to build a culture of cybersecurity.  \n\nThis also means formulating policies and establishing processes (and actually following them!) is an approach that all companies need to be doing to ensure employees follow good practices and don't move away from established rules. \n\n# 8. Insider threats and privilege misuse \n\nSometimes, it's easy to focus on preventing unwanted access from external actors and forgetting that harm can also be done from the inside. Malicious or unintentional actions by employees with privileged access can pose significant security risks. \n\nEstimates vary but most research agrees that more than half of security breaches experienced are a result of internal threats or abuse of privilege. \n\n## Protecting against insider threats \n\nTo prevent against damage caused by current or previous employees, ensure that: \n\n* When offboarding users, you're removing all access and not leaving any dangling permissions that can be abused, \n* You're following the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only assigning the necessary permissions for the amount of time required, \n* You're monitoring user activity and performing regular assessments of user access and permissions. \n\n# 9. Cryptographic keys management \n\nManaging encryption keys effectively is critical for safeguarding data. With the growing volume of encrypted data in the cloud, ensuring secure storage, access, rotation, and revocation of encryption keys has become challenging. \n\nWhy is the way you store and manage cryptographic keys so important? A good example is the leak of 38TB of secrets that occurred in 2023, when a GitHub repository owned by Microsoft’s AI research division provided a link to a misconfigured Azure storage resource. \n\n[Microsoft AI Researchers exposed](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsoft-ai-accidently-leaked-38tb/) crypto keys, passwords, and other data through a storage account that could be accessed using leaked SAS (Shared Access Signature) tokens. If encryption keys are leaked, the effort of encrypting data goes to waste. \n\nAnd it’s not just about protecting data but maintaining access to it. If an encryption key expires before it’s rotated out, you could end up losing access to precious data.  \n\n## Effective cryptographic keys management \n\nAs part of an effective CSPM approach, you need a solid crypto key management strategy. Cloud security platforms like Cyscale check a wide palette of settings using security controls across multiple cloud service providers to ensure keys on different platforms remain secure. \n\nA few examples are: \n\n* Ensure encryption keys are not expiring within the next 14 days \n* Ensure encryption keys don't have permissive access policies \n* Ensure in-use encryption keys are not scheduled for deletion \n* Ensure Cloud KMS cryptokeys are not anonymously or publicly accessible \n\n  <video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n# 10. Incident Response \n\nPreventative cybersecurity measures will only take you so far. Developing and implementing robust incident response plans specific to cloud environments is essential.  \n\nAccording to the [annual M-Trends report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/m-trends-2023) by Mandiant, part of Google, global median dwell time was down to 16 days in 2023 from 21 the year before, meaning attacks are being detected more quickly than ever before.  \n\nAlthough this decrease is in part down to better tools and better approaches by defenders, an explosion in ransomware is also driving this number down as the point of these attacks is to make themselves known for extortion purposes.  \n\nSo, when it comes to responding to an active incident, speed is of the essence.  \n\n## Effective incident response in cloud security \n\nGiven the volume of tasks and pressure on human resources, automation can take a lot of the toil out of triage, prioritization, and remediation when it comes to detecting and acting on incidents.  \n\nEffective coordination, timely response to security incidents, and comprehensive recovery strategies are vital for minimizing damage and restoring operations. \n\nFinally, while resumption of normal operations is the priority, care should also be taken to preserve evidence during the recovery and remediation phases. In some cases this may even be a regulatory requirement.  \n\n## Challenges and opportunities in 2024: Adapting amid technological shifts   \n\nThe challenges of 2024 bring forward a landscape where technological advancements intertwine with vulnerabilities, creating a need for adaptable and comprehensive security strategies.  \n\nAs we navigate AI-driven threats, the looming potential of quantum computing, and growing multi-cloud environments, hackers find ever-more innovative ways to attack companies, and so we must focus on fortifying our defenses, meaning proactive measures become imperative. \n\nTo prepare for this changing landscape, book a free cloud security health assessment with Cyscale.

This is why effective cyber due diligence is essential for all involved, including situations where there will not be a merging or integration of systems, such as with the acquisition of a firm by private equity (PE) for example.  \n\n## Technology: Opportunity or risk? \n\nIn recent years mindsets have shifted, and companies no longer see technology as a cost of doing business as part of the M&A process, but instead as a way of accelerating growth or getting ahead in a market.  \n\n[PWC notes that technology is empowering CEOs to digitalise and transform businesses,](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html) and AI has changed the game, with a disruptive impact that will create M&A opportunities as both corporates and private equity firms move to acquire new businesses or potentially exit them to monetize returns.  \n\n“We’ve been seeing for some time the growing skills challenge faced by organisations driving acquisition strategies. AI has upped the game here too, with AI talent being one of the scarcest resources to find,” PWC said in its 2023 mid-year update on Global M&A Industry Trends. \n\n[According to Accenture,](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/strategy/mapping-dna-mergers-acquisitions-value) 74% of CEOs see tech integration in M&A as a growth enabler or source of competitive advantage, but only 21% say tech due diligence was conducted for most of their deals over the past three years (to 2022).  \n\nThe obvious issue here becomes even more clear when the same report finds that 96% of CIOs have seen tech due diligence uncover issues or opportunities that made a material impact on the deal.  \n\n## Cybersecurity due diligence in M&A \n\nIt seems to be the case that one aspect that's often overlooked, yet fundamentally critical in the M&A process, is comprehensive planning for the integration of IT systems, including cloud environments.  \n\nIt’s possible that lack of education plays a role here, especially in cases where a company is being acquired for its technology by a more established acquirer built on legacy systems looking to keep pace with the market.  \n\nWhile it may not look complicated from the outside, it is not the case that merging two cloud-based organizations, even when both are using the same cloud provider, will ease the integration.  \n\nThe same is true when the merger will create a hybrid environment mixing on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.  \n\nEither way, integrating a new cloud environment can introduce a lot of new misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in both directions. This article intends to explore why the M&A process needs to be addressed as a cloud security challenge just as much, if not more, as an operational challenge. \n\n## Approaching cybersecurity proactively during M&A  \n\nIdeally, a full cybersecurity audit, including cloud security, will be carried out as part of the due diligence phase of a merger or acquisition. And in cases where there is to be a merging of infrastructure, an audit should again be carried out on day zero of the integration. \n\nThe negative consequences of failing to comprehensively assess your cloud security include: \n\n* Reputational risks and damage to brand \n* Increased costs down the road, either from the integration itself, lost revenue, or fines for compliance failings or security breaches \n* Failure to comply with existing or newly acquired compliance overheads, regional laws and regulations, resulting in fines or increased spend  \n* Overlooked or lost intellectual property, especially relevant due to the boom in AI and associated tech IP \n* Customer impact including increased friction and churn due to broken or problematic systems \n\n## Common misconceptions when integrating a new cloud environment  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n* **We both use the same cloud platform so the integration will be easy:** Unique configurations, architectures, and approaches mean that no two cloud environments are alike, even on the same platform. \n* **We’re mostly on-prem so it’s just adding a new technology:** The cloud is a wildly different environment to anything that has come before and even now there is a significant shortage of experience and expertise in the market. Many security problems arise from a lack of education about how to operate safely in the cloud.  \n* **We will audit the cloud environment at a later date:** Due to its public nature, security incidents in the cloud happen in real time. A new zero-day vulnerability in a common software package can be exploited on a mass scale hours after being revealed. A DevOps team spinning up a new instance with a misconfiguration can open your entire infrastructure up to risk. Cloud security posture has to be monitored constantly.  \n* **We can rely on our existing toolset or expertise:** The difference from one cloud platform to another is considerable. They even use different terminology. An expert in AWS is not necessarily an expert in Azure, and security tools may not comprehensively cover multiple environments. The introduction of another cloud is the introduction of another risk, and another visibility challenge.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>\n\n## Cloud security risks that come with an M&A event: Real examples \n\n### Data leakage \n\nWhen moving data from one cloud service provider to another, mistakes are bound to happen. In one case a company was moving some sensitive files from AWS S3 buckets to an Azure Storage Account.  \n\nDuring the migration, the team utilized Shared Access Signatures (SAS) in Azure to control access to the stored data. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of the migration process, the team hastily generated SAS tokens with overly broad permissions. \n\nInstead of applying fine-grained access controls to specific resources or limiting access to authorized personnel, the tokens granted broader read and write permissions across a wider range of containers or blobs within the Azure Storage Account. \n\nThis misconfiguration inadvertently exposed sensitive data, including financial records and proprietary algorithms. \n\n**Solution:** Even though a migration can be daunting, take it step by step and understand the [best practices of cloud resources](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) you’re using so you can make informed decisions. For example, in the case of storage accounts in Azure, a recommendation is to use RBAC (Role-based access control), rather than SAS signatures.  \n\nIt’s not enough to understand the technology you’ve been using to date, you also need to have a good grasp of the new cloud provider you’re integrating with as every cloud’s approach is different.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\"><img src=\"/img/data-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/></a>\n\n### Attempting integration of incompatible systems \n\nHarmonizing disparate IT systems, particularly cloud environments, is a formidable challenge in M&A events. Incompatible technologies can create vulnerabilities that malicious actors may exploit.  \n\nIn one case two companies performed encryption for PII differently, and when they ultimately had to merge the sensitive data from two different repositories, the data had to be decrypted and then re-encrypted in a unified manner. This opened up the possibility of several risks – what happens to the data while it’s unencrypted? And where is it stored?  \n\n**Solution:** When it comes to sensitive data, such as PII, time is of the essence but it’s more important to do the work properly, so don’t rush to process it and skip steps. \n\nMinimize the time data is unencrypted. Decrypt the data only when necessary for the merge and re-encrypt it promptly after the process is complete. Moreover, perform the decryption and re-encryption within a secure, controlled environment with restricted access. Use encrypted communication channels and isolated systems to prevent unauthorized access to the unencrypted data. \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#data\">\n  <img src=\"/img/encryption-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:32.0625rem;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'> See how Cyscale solved this challenge by revealing encryption status for data <br class=\"hidden lg:block\">\n    and identifying misconfigurations in data stores</span>\n</a>\n\n### Lack of visibility into the extended cloud estate \n\nOne of the big problems that often appears during or after a merger or an acquisition is the lack of visibility into the new or extended cloud estate. When you have to deal with complex infrastructures and unknown environments, security issues can creep in without you noticing. Roles or permissions that should be onboarded or offboarded, redundant VMs that have to be deprovisioned, storage resources that have to be deleted, these are just some examples of cloud resources that may change during an M&A.  \n\nWithout great visibility into a changing environment, mistakes are bound to happen. \n\n**Solution:** To gain much-needed visibility in the cloud, have an active inventory of all your cloud resources and assets, and ideally, the context of how they all interconnect. There are tools which will automatically scan your estate and build an inventory, and some use dashboards to help visualize your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) even across multiple clouds. \n\nFurthermore, perform access reviews to thoroughly understand the permissions users have and whether they are overprovisioned or even redundant.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#inventory\">\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='text-center block'>See how Cyscale gives you full visibility of your cloud estate by revealing all assets \n    and their issues in minutes</span>\n</a>\n\n### Expanding compliance and regulatory challenges \n\nM&A events can often cross multiple geographic or legal jurisdictions, each with its own set of compliance requirements. Ensuring alignment with these diverse regulatory landscapes can be a daunting task, and failure to meet compliance standards can lead to severe penalties and legal consequences. \n\nFor example, for some companies, data sovereignty is an important aspect. This means that some companies, due to compliance requirements, have to store all data related to a specific geography on that country’s territory. If one organization acquired another to get access to a new market, they must ensure continued compliance with data sovereignty requirements in the event of merging of infrastructure or face possible legal battles and substantial fines.  \n\nCommon examples include the applicability of US State Privacy Laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other state-specific laws. Or the applicability of EU/UK GDPR and other international laws, all of which highlight the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of regulatory environments and meticulous due diligence in M&A scenarios. \n\n**Solution:** When an M&A event happens, ensure that you understand the compliance requirements related to all parties and create a detailed plan to minimize any disruption from the merger or integration process.  \n\nIn terms of data sovereignty, this means understanding how to store data in the country where it’s supposed to be stored.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"#compliance\">\n    <img src=\"/img/compliance-dash.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"blog-image-shadow\" style=\"width:38.563rem;height:auto;\" data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n    <br>\n    <span class='block text-center'>See how Cyscale helps you comply with dozens of standards out of the box\n    and offers support for custom controls</span>\n</a>\n\n### See how we build an asset inventory in this video\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQj8Yo71DvQ?rel=0&modestbranding=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n## Approaching cloud security in M&A holistically  \n\nAlthough the considerations set out in this article make an M&A event seem daunting, going into the process with an understanding of what to look out for is half the battle. Proper planning and a comprehensive assessment of your cloud infrastructure(s) during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merge will ensure the process runs smoothly and safely. \n\nThe Cyscale platform is designed to help close these security gaps by providing continuous visibility, security controls, and a single dashboard through which to assess your security posture across multiple clouds, including policies and compliance.  \n\n### Preparing for M&A with a cloud security assessment \n\nThe Cyscale cloud security platform is an agentless cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that can help you assess risk during both the due diligence process and day zero of the merger and integration.  \n\n<strong id=\"inventory\">Inventory</strong>\n\nTo start with, a fully automated security assessment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and Kubernetes assets will provide you with comprehensive insights into your partner’s cloud estate, including all vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, in a matter of minutes.  \n\nThis will give you a full asset inventory and flag any urgent issues that need to be addressed. The Cyscale Graph View means that misconfigurations are analyzed in context, automatically correlating issues that affect compute, data storage and identity assets, determining their real impact on data security and helping prioritize remediation efforts. \n\n<strong id=\"data\">Data</strong>\n\nThe assessment will also identify all data stores and give you valuable information about encryption status for data at rest, encryption keys, as well as identifying any object containers and databases with issues, such as public access, permissive access policies, or lack of deletion protection.  \n\nThis can help ensure your crown jewels are protected, prevent data leakage, and ensure solid foundations for tasks like merging encrypted databases.  \n\n<strong id=\"compliance\">Compliance</strong>\n\nIn terms of both planning the integration work and having ongoing proof of compliance, Cyscale has in-app support for dozens of compliance standards, including CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST and more. \n\nAll these compliance standards and controls are analyzed within the Cyscale app, taking into account the unique cloud infrastructures and their related vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nThis consolidates your reputation as a transparent, data-focused organization that proves to customers, auditors, and regulatory compliance bodies how robustly it protects Personally Identifiable Information (PII). \n\nAn easy-to-understand report can then be used to make the case for additional funding or remediation requirements, for both technical stakeholders such as CTOs, CISOs, and security engineers, as well as more business-minded executives such as CFOs, CEOs or the Board.  \n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/request-demo/\">\n    <img src=\"/img/assessment-cta.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" id='cta-image' data-ignore=\"true\"/>\n</a>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":8,"currentPage":1,"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","seoTitle":"Sabrina Lupsan - Insights from a Cloud Security Analyst - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Discover how Sabrina Lupsan, a seasoned Cloud Security Analyst at Cyscale, integrates academic expertise and research to advance cloud security practices.","authorSlug":"sabrina-lupsan"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","2024892666","220583031","273821743","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
