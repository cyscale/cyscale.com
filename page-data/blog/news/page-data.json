These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Cloud Security"],"title":"Cloud Security Wrapped Reveals Bucket Misconfigurations as Main Concern","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Wrapped Reveals Bucket Misconfigurations as Main Concern","description":"Cyscale’s inaugural Cloud Security Wrapped revealed buckets as the source of most high-severity security alerts.

This means you can retrieve and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket, preventing deletion or overwriting of that object. \n\nIn a business that often creates new buckets, or updates objects in storage frequently, Cyscale’s custom controls would [check that the buckets are correctly configured](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). Without this check an organization could easily lose sensitive or important data. This is clearly something a significant portion of our customer base is concerned with. \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Reduce cloud security assessments from weeks to minutes \n\nSpeed is of the essence too. Although we were unable to draw averages from our customer base due to their wildly different internal processes, we were able to establish that broadly speaking, it can take a company up to two weeks to do the necessary data gathering and analysis to identify and assess misconfigurations on cloud resources like buckets. \n\nThis is before a manual prioritization of issues, considered against the company's specific operational and compliance requirements. \n\nWhat we could establish universally however, is that a customer using Cyscale was able to onboard their cloud environments (such as AWS) and perform their first scan to identify any misconfigured S3 buckets within 15 minutes.  \n\nThe [prioritization of identified issues happens in real-time](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) based on custom controls, eg. an S3 bucket discovered without versioning enabled would be flagged as a high-priority alert immediately. \n\nThis reduces a highly manual process taking two weeks, down to a highly automated 15 minutes.  \n\n## Cloud risk reduction of up to 70% \n\nOverall, we were able to reduce our customers’ cloud risk by an average of 16%. While this may not sound a lot, it takes into account many frequently changing cloud estates, where Cyscale is constantly surfacing new issues. We must also consider the rapid development of the Cyscale platform itself, which surfaces new issues as capabilities are deployed.  \n\nOne customer did in fact see a 70% reduction in risk, which speaks to our mission of being able to point you towards the top 20-30% of issues that will significantly reduce your risk.  \n\nThis finding is also a nod to the time saved by instantly seeing where vulnerable images and code are running within your infrastructure and making those findings prominent, reducing alert fatigue. \n\nEvery customer’s cloud infrastructure is unique, so it’s hard to draw common benefits, but since [we introduced the Scopes feature](https://cyscale.com/blog/major-update-cyscale/) earlier this year, many customers have reported architecture improvements carried out by leveraging asset graphs after segmenting their workloads into useful groups with Scopes.  \n\n## Tuesday is the day for security tasks  \n\nFinally, what would a year in review be without an interesting fact? While we were looking at our data set, one day of the week stood out as the most popular day for getting cloud security tasks ticked off, and that was Tuesday.  \n\nWhat is it about Tuesdays that make them the preferred day for productivity? We can’t say for sure, but we do know one customer topped the productivity leaderboard one particular Tuesday, by breezing through over 4,800 remediations.  \n\n<div class=\"pb-2 pt-12 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">SEE CLOUD SECURITY WRAPPED</button></a></div>\n\n## Find unused cloud resources and save money \n\nThat’s not all though. If we dive into the data, there’s more to add to the big picture from small victories achieved by our customers that cannot be measured as easily. \n\nPeriodic IAM (Identity and Access Management) reviews can be accelerated and, in some cases, mostly automated, as Cyscale identifies excessive permissions, left-over users that need offboarding, and optimizes user management by revealing overprivileged accounts or entitlements that are not in use.  \n\nAnd there is also a great opportunity for cloud security solutions like Cyscale to help reduce your cloud infrastructure costs by identifying left-over and unused resources, as well as shadow infrastructure that has crept into your estate without your knowledge.\n\n<a href=\"https://5413427.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5413427/Cyscale%20Wrapped%202023.pdf\"><img src=\"/img/wrapped-email.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant: Making Cloud Security More Intuitive","seoTitle":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant | Cyscale","description":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","seoDescription":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","date":"2023-11-02T13:00:05.768Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/blog-cover-ai-assistant.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/41be8/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/c78f7/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/913d0/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/91660/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/888e2/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"Cyscale, [the platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily,](https://cyscale.com/) is excited to give a first glimpse into the potential enabled by generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM),  unveiling our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question. \n\nAs engineers we’ve spent almost 20 years working with the cloud, and the complexity of cloud environments mean it’s now impossible to correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually to expose real risk, especially if you have a small team.  \n\nGenerating security alerts is not the problem. The problem is understanding them in context, and it's getting harder for a CTO or CISO to [prioritize remediation because of the volume of alerts](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/).   \n\nWe think context is king, and the value of Cyscale is in our application of graph technology to inventory all cloud assets and the relationships between those assets to [identify and prioritize real security threats](https://cyscale.com/blog/contextual-security-google-cloud/).   \n\nNow with developments in AI we are taking this value even further by enabling our platform to automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues using our customers’ cloud footprint combined with Large Language Models (LLM) of vulnerabilities and exploits.    \n\nIn our first look at Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant you can see how we’re making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\n## D﻿emonstration of Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant\n\n <br class=\"\" />\n \n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/boWgsssdTDI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThe key value here is the democratization of cloud security. Regardless of your skill level, the Security Assistant connects all the dots between disparate information sources so you don’t have to. This means security practitioners struggling to keep up with technical tasks can get information that’s relevant to them, just the same as compliance officers can get information about security posture through a lens that’s more relevant to their interests.  \n\nThis example shows you just the very tip of what’s possible by asking the Assistant questions such as:  \n\n* Which security controls have failed?   \n* What are my top three vulnerabilities and their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score?  \n* How can I fix these vulnerabilities on their specific cloud platform?   \n\n## Democratizing cloud security with AI\n\nNot only does this approach help people in different functions (security, DevOps, compliance) get information that’s more contextually relevant to their role, it helps them perform tasks faster by giving links directly to the affected assets in question, and clear instructions on how to fix associated issues.   \n\nIt also helps security professionals navigate multi-cloud environments by abstracting the unique and different terminologies used from one cloud provider to another (‘termination’ versus ‘deallocation’ for example) into more natural language. \n\n> “Cybersecurity may have become cloud security, but it’s becoming less and less human friendly,” says Ovidiu Cical, Cyscale CEO. “It’s now impossible for a CTO, CISO, or security practitioner to stay on top of an endless list of alerts and things that need fixing without automation. Companies like us have made great strides in automating these processes and providing context but it’s still a lot of information for small teams to digest and act on.” \n>\n> “With these rapid developments in AI assistance we can help different kinds of people interact with our tools in a more natural and contextually relevant way. AI is actually making cloud security more human,” Ovidiu adds.   \n\nThis is important because [Gartner estimates that 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure), mainly through failures to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. Automation puts people back in control by helping them better manage cloud complexity, security, and compliance. \n\nCyscale’s Security Assistant is still in development, so stay tuned for more insights into the potential unlocked by AI, but existing customers and new prospects can request to have it added to their account for testing.  \n\n[B﻿ook a demo to see](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) it in action."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","seoTitle":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures due to failure to disclose significant cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities over at least a two-year period.

Moreover, they have routinely overstated their cybersecurity best practices and misled investors.  \n\nSEC’s complaint seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown”, SolarWinds’ CISO. \n\nSEC’s actions show that cybersecurity should be taken seriously and should include adequate prevention as well as remediation strategies, otherwise companies may face serious legal consequences.  \n\nIt is important to identify ongoing risks and apply effective measures to increase security posture, but also to take an objective and realistic view. The SEC statement reveals that an internal document from SolarWinds’ mentions that “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”  \n\nThis is not an uncommon predicament. Companies frequently find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to security issues and often fail to allocate enough funds and personnel to rectify them. Furthermore, ‘alert fatigue’ is a rapidly growing problem, where security tools generate so many alerts that assessing and fixing them becomes an impossible task.  \n\nThis is one of the key issues Cyscale set out to solve. Through the application of context to each security alert, Cyscale’s mission is to help companies overcome the challenges of slim resources and budgets by prioritizing security issues and guiding professionals to work on the 20% of things that matter and make 80% of the difference.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","seoTitle":"Cyscale Featured in The Europas Awards Nominations as Cybersecurity Startup to Watch ","description":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","seoDescription":"Cyscale has been nominated for Hottest Cybersecurity Startup against five other entrants as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security.","date":"2023-10-24T11:26:33.738Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cyscale-europas-hottest-cybersecurity-startup","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/cyscale-europas-awards.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg","srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/41be8/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/c78f7/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/2c0f5/cyscale-europas-awards.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/913d0/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 205w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/91660/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 410w,\n/static/026daca89ca1336ce6ffda2227696e4f/888e2/cyscale-europas-awards.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"We are super excited to reveal that Cyscale – the [platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily](https://cyscale.com/) – has made the longlist for The Europas Awards 2023.  \n\n[The Europas,](https://www.theeuropas.com/) founded by Tech Crunch’s Mike Butcher, has been Europe’s most prestigious startup awards program for the last 15 years and has been instrumental in identifying some of the world’s most ambitious and successful startups, including Spotify, Deliveroo, Wise, and Starling Bank among many others.  \n\nCyscale entered the awards along with 400 other European startups and has made the cut in the cybersecurity category against five other entrants.  \n\n“It’s great to see Cyscale acknowledged among the Europas nominees as the only cybersecurity company that focuses on cloud security,” said Cyscale CEO Ovidiu Cical.  \n\n“Over 400 startups entered these awards and all of them are building their game-changing applications in the cloud. Some companies are even targeting regulated sectors like fintech, healthtech, and insuretech, where security and compliance are critical factors,” Ovidiu added.  \n\n“While the cloud has become the great enabler for these innovations, it’s also the complexity of the cloud that is killing businesses. There are now more controls and configurations than is humanly possible to keep track of, and one mistake – one misconfiguration or vulnerability in your cloud – can cost you your reputation and your business,” he said.  \n\nCyscale is pioneering the application of cloud security for other startups, scaleups, and SaaS builders by focusing on ease of use and time to value. The CTO or CISO of a startup building out its tech stack doesn’t have the time or the skillset to spend days in every week chasing security alerts.  \n\nSo, Cyscale empowers these companies by not only automatically identifying security problems, but also giving the context needed to prioritize remediation and providing guidance on how to fix issues.  \n\nCyscale is already helping companies secure and monitor their multi-cloud assets and data with our context-driven approach, and we are now looking to harness the power of AI to replace existing security tools with prompts and make an automated and scalable security team available to every cloud-centric company.

During August, when lots of people were on summer vacation, a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory was exposed.  \n\nAs with the two vulnerabilities the CSRB reviewed previously - Log4J in July of 2022 and Lapsus$ also in August of 2023 – the Azure Active Directory vulnerability highlights significant challenges in terms of remediation, due to the sprawling nature of cloud resources and their direct and indirect dependencies on assets that might, or might not, be affected.  \n\nEven for large organizations with sizeable security teams, navigating a complex dependency graph to understand which resources have dependencies on affected assets is a challenge. For SaaS startups with perhaps a handful of people building out their technology stack, such investigations are impossible.  \n\nAs a result, the findings of the CSRB’s reports and its recommendations for best practice build a strong case for contextually aware cloud security practices.  \n\n## How does this affect you (and everyone else)? \n\nIn its most recent announcement, the CSRB made it clear that identity access management (IAM) and authentication are in focus due to being one of the most vulnerable areas in a cloud environment. Identity management vulnerabilities are a key entry point for hackers, and SaaS companies and large enterprises are falling victim repeatedly. From IAM misconfigurations that CTOs and developers miss when setting up and managing their environment, to cloud service provider bugs, this area needs critical attention to ensure safe and secure cloud environments. \n\n## Did I just say cloud service provider bugs?  \n\nYes, I did. The incident in question that kicked off this latest review less than two months ago, was the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory (soon to be renamed Microsoft Entra ID) that was allowing hackers to fabricate authentication tokens. Around 25 organizations including US government entities were impacted by this bug before it was discovered, with attackers stealing mailbox data and obtaining access to sensitive emails.  \n\nFor cloud native organizations building their entire business on public cloud platforms, this shared responsibility model is one of the most misunderstood (or ignored) aspects.  \n\nWhen the terms & conditions say that the cloud is a ‘shared responsibility’, it really is. It’s the cloud service provider’s job to secure the platform or infrastructure, and your job to secure the apps and data, and if one party fails (in this case, the cloud service provider – Microsoft Azure), your company, and potentially your customers and partners, are left exposed. \n\nThe CSRB’s previous two reports on [Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/csrb-log4j-key-findings-and-recommendations-summary) and [Lapsus$](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/review-attacks-associated-lapsus-and-related-threat-groups-executive-summary) have been very thorough and made some great recommendations that we hope will advance cybersecurity practices, which is why we’re eagerly waiting for CSRB’s report on cloud security. It not only promises a thorough set of recommendations for CISOs, CTOs, and developers, but it will also sound the alarm for cloud service providers.  \n\nAlthough the Cyber Safety Review Board has no regulatory power, its findings are transmitted to US President Biden and used to develop Executive Orders, so we can expect to see its influence in regulations such as [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), and perhaps best practices adopted into SOC 2, ISO 27001, and others. \n\n## The importance of contextual security \n\nWhat’s become evident is that simply informing businesses and cloud providers of the discovery of far-reaching misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is not enough. In fact, the potential workload created by responding to these challenges can be just as dangerous in that it can consume all an organization’s security resources.  \n\nContext is important and [contextual security](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) is the most significant development in cloud infrastructure security in recent years. Identifying that a VM has the Log4J vulnerability is not the same as saying that an Internet-facing VM has the same vulnerability. Of course, they are both just as vulnerable, but if the first VM is running in a private network, the severity is not as high as for the one accessible from the Internet. The risk is not the same, but the alert will be, and we all know alert fatigue is a very real problem.  \n\nWrong prioritization, or no prioritization at all, can make all the difference between a secure cloud environment and a breach."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Makes Sifted’s Ones to Watch List in RegTech and DeepTech","seoTitle":"Cyscale Makes Sifted’s Ones to Watch List in RegTech and DeepTech","description":"Cyscale – the cloud security platform – has been listed in Sifted’s 100 Companies to Watch in both RegTech and DeepTech, as demands for compliance and regulation technology accelerate in line with interest in risk management and AI.
