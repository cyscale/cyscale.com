Most of the time, this energy steers towards building a great product or solution, leaving security far behind. When you add the lack of cybersecurity resources and often prohibitive costs of security solutions, it becomes a recipe for security breaches. \n\nMe and my co-founders, Manuela and Andrei, spent ten years helping security teams define and maintain security programs. Still, the tools and solutions at our disposal were not good enough. We started building the Cyscale Platform because we genuinely wanted to help companies start, improve, and maintain a security program regardless of their stage, not just burden them with yet another security tool. We made this our mission.  \n\nToday, we believe our [stellar team](https://cyscale.com/about-us/) has delivered a product that is ready to help others. The Cyscale Platform enables our own security program today, from defining and enforcing Secure-SDLC and MDM policies to preparing for the ISO 27001 and [SOC 2 compliance audits](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/). We want other startups to have the same advantage in case security is not their area of expertise. \n\n**Advantages** \n\n* Access to the entire Cyscale Cloud Platform with Powerful Analytics & Dashboards (up to 1000 protected assets), \n* Integrations with [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/), [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/), and Alibaba cloud, \n* Asset inventory, \n* [Misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/), \n* Alerts and remediation instructions in case of security drifts, \n* Built-in frameworks for ISO27001, PCI-DSS, SOC2, GDPR, and others. \n\n**Qualification criteria** \n\nTo be eligible for the discounted program, startups must meet all of the following criteria: \n\n1. Founded less than **five years** ago \n2. Funding: \n\n* **up to $2M** in funding: **6 months FREE** + 75% off for the next 6 months over,  \n* **$2M+** in funding: **3 months FREE** + 75% off for the next 9 months. \n\nOverall, the Cyscale for Startups Program is similar to our [Pro Plan](https://cyscale.com/pricing/) but with two limits: standard T&Cs and no dedicated support. Once the program ends, our Customer Success Team can help you evaluate and decide on the best plan for you. \n\n**Getting started** \n\nYou can [apply to the program](https://cyscale.com/security-for-startups-program/) regardless of whether you’re new to Cyscale or an existing Cyscale customer. You only have to meet our qualification criteria above. \n\nBy implementing an early cybersecurity program using the Cyscale Platform, startups can take advantage of our intensive cloud security research, up-to-date compliance frameworks mapping, and [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) in improving their security posture without spending too much or hiring specialized staff. The purpose is to raise awareness about the importance of security and compliance in the cloud. \n\nIf you don’t meet these criteria but are still interested in learning more about Cyscale, you can [sign up for free](https://app.cyscale.com/) or book a [demo](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Announcing the Playground!

In this case, Romania's largest real estate portal has suffered a data breach due to a misconfiguration. Website Planet detected that the portal's AWS S3 buckets were publicly available without any protection, back in December 2020. As a result, more than 200,000 records were exposed.\n\nAnyone with the URL could access the buckets and Personal Identifying Information (PII) stored there. Users' data such as full names, emails, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (CNP), or even scanned copies of national ID cards including identifying codes were leaked.\n\nThe AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 Access Points feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help companies manage the public access to their resources. More information can be found on Amazon's Documentation Portal:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/\npremiumsupport/\nknowledge-center/\nread-access-objects-s3-bucket\n\nBy default, new buckets do not allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies and allow public access. Since these individual settings are customizations enabled to better suit a specific organization's needs, the responsibility is no longer with the cloud provider.\n\nEven if the unintentional breach was fixed after Website Planet reported it, the precise number of people affected remains unknown and the culpability for this data leak lies entirely with the real estate portal.\n\nThis could have easily been prevented with the implementation of a [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). These solutions are developed to [detect any misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and to prevent this type of event.\n\nAs a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cyscale Cloud Platform is the perfect tool that helps companies reduce risk. It enables complete visibility and control over cloud accounts in under 5 minutes since deployment.\n\nCyscale's platform is equipped with an alert mechanism, that detects and informs security and cloud ops about exposed assets and helps them address these issues in time.\n\nMistakes such as having your company's buckets exposed, without password protection or encryption can be detected and fixed in time, you just need someone to guide you. We are ready to assist you with your Cloud Security.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"Hello Darkness, my old friend!","seoTitle":null,"description":"At Cyscale, we see Darkness as a force for good.
