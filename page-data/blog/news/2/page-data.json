SOC (Service and Organization Controls) 2 is an international standard developed by AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). \n\nIn this article, we will understand what requirements your company needs to fulfill to obtain the [SOC 2 certifications](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/) and how to implement them correctly in your AWS environment. \n\n### The requirements \n\nFirstly, the rules within SOC 2 are grouped by 5 TSC (Trust Service Criteria): \n\n1. Security \n2. Availability \n3. Processing Integrity \n4. Confidentiality \n5. Privacy \n\nSOC 2 has 64 mandatory trust service criteria, based on these which the company creates controls to achieve compliance. In this article, we will look at a few of the criteria required, how to implement them in your AWS environment and how to check if your implementation is complete. \n\n##### A checklist \n\n### Requires Additional Authentication or Credentials \n\nMFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a mechanism that adds additional steps to the authentication flow and requests supplementary credentials. These credentials can be: \n\n* What you know (for example: a password) \n* What you have (for example: a smart card) \n* What you are (for example: a fingerprint) \n\nTo fulfill this criteria, introduced under the “Security” section, you need to enable MFA when accessing the AWS Management Console. As a result, users will be prompted to enter their username and password (which is the first step, or the first factor of the authentication), and then an authentication code that is sent to their device. A biometrics-enabled device can be used instead as well. \n\nYou can configure MFA for IAM users or the AWS account root user. \n\nSteps to enable MFA in your AWS environment, according to the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable.html). \n\n6. Install an authenticator app on your MFA device, use a FIDO2 device or specialized hardware devices such as TOTP tokens. \n7. Enable the MFA device from the AWS Management Console (if using an authenticator app, you can also use AWS CLI or AWS API). \n\nIf your company is using an external identity provider, you have to ensure that MFA is configured for access to the AWS console. \n\n### Restricts Access \n\nThis criteria, in the “Security” TSC refers to restricting traffic to and from any cloud services and assets hosted in the cloud. This includes: \n\n* Closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* Requiring authenticated access to services such as FTP, SMB, and others. \n\nTo close an open port, follow these steps: \n\n1. Log in to the AWS Management Console. \n2. From the EC2 dashboard, on the left pane, click Security Groups. \n3. For each security group, click the Inbound Rules tab, and remove the rules that allow access to the ports you want to close. Repeat the same for the Outbound Rules. \n4. Remember to click save. \n\n### Implements Boundary Protection Systems \n\nThe third requirement we will analyze under the \"Security\" section of SOC refers to the usage of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), IDS, IPS, and others.  \n\nIt is recommended that you secure your cloud infrastructure by using these utilities in order to limit traffic as much as possible and only allow access to resources when necessary. \n\nTo quickly deploy a firewall: \n\n* Log in to the AWS Management Console, \n* Open the Amazon VPC console, create a firewall subnet, and update your VPC Route Tables. \n* Configure the firewall policy by accessing the Amazon VPC console navigation pane under Network Firewall. Choose Firewall policies and add any desired configurations. \n\n### Creates and Maintains Records of System Storage Activities \n\nThis criteria, located under the “Processing Integrity” criteria, checks if logging is implemented in your cloud environment.  \n\nBy logging all user activities, you can: \n\n* Observe [misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/), \n* Identify any suspicious behavior, \n* Detect malicious attacks. \n\nTo enable logging in your AWS infrastructure, you can use Amazon CloudTrail. This solution tracks all actions performed in your cloud environment.  \n\nAmazon CloudTrail can be used together with Amazon CloudWatch to extend monitoring to applications and cloud assets and to analyze their health. \n\n**Amazon CloudTrail is enabled by default in your AWS account.** \n\n### Protects Encryption Keys \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is essential to ensure confidentiality of data. In the “Confidentiality” section of SOC 2, we have criteria for both encryption and key management.  \n\nIf key management is neglected, then encryption becomes useless. Keys must be generated, stored, used and destroyed safely to protect your data. \n\nAmazon offers a complete solution for proper key management. AWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) helps you properly deal with all of the processes in a cryptographic key’s lifecycle. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used:  \n\n* Through the AWS Management Console,  \n* Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### Finally, check your implementations \n\nBesides the criteria presented in this article, there are many more. \n\nAlthough so many requirements can quickly become overwhelming, Cyscale can help you easily keep track of what you’ve correctly implemented and what requires your attention on our [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) compliance page. \n\nMany technical controls in Cyscale can be mapped to SOC 2 criteria to provide visibility in your cloud environment and prove compliance. \n\nA few examples of controls that apply to the presented requirements (and more) are: \n\n* Ensure all users have MFA configured. \n* Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions. \n* Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 (SSH). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News"],"title":"Announcing the Cyscale for Startups Program ","seoTitle":"Startups Program","description":"By implementing an early cybersecurity program using the Cyscale Platform, startups can take advantage of our intensive cloud security research, up-to-date compliance frameworks mapping, and best practices in improving their security posture without spending too much or hiring specialized staff.

Most of the time, this energy steers towards building a great product or solution, leaving security far behind. When you add the lack of cybersecurity resources and often prohibitive costs of security solutions, it becomes a recipe for security breaches. \n\nMe and my co-founders, Manuela and Andrei, spent ten years helping security teams define and maintain security programs. Still, the tools and solutions at our disposal were not good enough. We started building the Cyscale Platform because we genuinely wanted to help companies start, improve, and maintain a security program regardless of their stage, not just burden them with yet another security tool. We made this our mission.  \n\nToday, we believe our [stellar team](https://cyscale.com/about-us/) has delivered a product that is ready to help others. The Cyscale Platform enables our own security program today, from defining and enforcing Secure-SDLC and MDM policies to preparing for the ISO 27001 and [SOC 2 compliance audits](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/). We want other startups to have the same advantage in case security is not their area of expertise. \n\n**Advantages** \n\n* Access to the entire Cyscale Cloud Platform with Powerful Analytics & Dashboards (up to 1000 protected assets), \n* Integrations with [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/), [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/), and Alibaba cloud, \n* Asset inventory, \n* [Misconfiguration detection](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/), \n* Alerts and remediation instructions in case of security drifts, \n* Built-in frameworks for ISO27001, PCI-DSS, SOC2, GDPR, and others. \n\n**Qualification criteria** \n\nTo be eligible for the discounted program, startups must meet all of the following criteria: \n\n1. Founded less than **five years** ago \n2. Funding: \n\n* **up to $2M** in funding: **6 months FREE** + 75% off for the next 6 months over,  \n* **$2M+** in funding: **3 months FREE** + 75% off for the next 9 months. \n\nOverall, the Cyscale for Startups Program is similar to our [Pro Plan](https://cyscale.com/pricing/) but with two limits: standard T&Cs and no dedicated support. Once the program ends, our Customer Success Team can help you evaluate and decide on the best plan for you. \n\n**Getting started** \n\nYou can [apply to the program](https://cyscale.com/security-for-startups-program) regardless of whether you’re new to Cyscale or an existing Cyscale customer. You only have to meet our qualification criteria above. \n\nBy implementing an early cybersecurity program using the Cyscale Platform, startups can take advantage of our intensive cloud security research, up-to-date compliance frameworks mapping, and [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) in improving their security posture without spending too much or hiring specialized staff. The purpose is to raise awareness about the importance of security and compliance in the cloud. \n\nIf you don’t meet these criteria but are still interested in learning more about Cyscale, you can [sign up for free](https://app.cyscale.com/) or book a [demo](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Announcing the Playground!

In this case, Romania's largest real estate portal has suffered a data breach due to a misconfiguration. Website Planet detected that the portal's AWS S3 buckets were publicly available without any protection, back in December 2020. As a result, more than 200,000 records were exposed.\n\nAnyone with the URL could access the buckets and Personal Identifying Information (PII) stored there. Users' data such as full names, emails, phone numbers, Social Security Numbers (CNP), or even scanned copies of national ID cards including identifying codes were leaked.\n\nThe AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 Access Points feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help companies manage the public access to their resources. More information can be found on Amazon's Documentation Portal:\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/\npremiumsupport/\nknowledge-center/\nread-access-objects-s3-bucket\n\nBy default, new buckets do not allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies and allow public access. Since these individual settings are customizations enabled to better suit a specific organization's needs, the responsibility is no longer with the cloud provider.\n\nEven if the unintentional breach was fixed after Website Planet reported it, the precise number of people affected remains unknown and the culpability for this data leak lies entirely with the real estate portal.\n\nThis could have easily been prevented with the implementation of a [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). These solutions are developed to [detect any misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and to prevent this type of event.\n\nAs a [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cyscale Cloud Platform is the perfect tool that helps companies reduce risk.
