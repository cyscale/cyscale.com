According to the [Medicare Learning Network](https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/HIPAAPrivacyandSecurity.pdf), the three rules are: \n\n* The Privacy Rule, \n* The Security Rule, \n* The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nWe will look at each in detail to understand how compliance with HIPAA can be achieved in the cloud. \n\n## The Privacy Rule \n\nThe Privacy Rule contains standards that regulate the usage and disclosure of PHI. This section of HIPAA includes a wide range of rules that protect an individual's rights to: \n\n* Access and obtain digital copies of their medical records, \n* Request corrections regarding their medical records, \n* Restrict access to some of their information. \n\nThe Privacy Rule also contains instructions for the medical provider. A medical professional must: \n\n1. Keep PHI secure and disable access to it unless the person requesting access is authorized to access it, \n2. Inform patients about their privacy rights and others. \n\n## The Security Rule \n\nThis rule refers to electronic PHI (ePHI). It requires that ePHI data is stored, accessed, and transferred under the three cybersecurity principles: \n\n1. Confidentiality,  \n2. Availability, \n3. Integrity. \n\nLet’s understand what these three principles require: \n\n* **Confidentiality**: Make sure no unauthorized individual can access or read the ePHI. \n* **Availability**: Authorized persons should be able at all times to access the ePHI, as needed. \n* **Integrity**: ePHI should not be altered or deleted by unauthorized entities. \n\n## The Breach Notification Rule \n\nThe third rule in HIPAA refers to how a medical professional should respond to a PHI breach.  \n\nThe parties that should always be notified of a breach are: \n\n* The affected individual or individuals, and \n* The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \n\n## Consequences of HIPAA violations \n\nSince HIPAA is a federal law, there are two types of penalties that can be applied: \n\n* Financial penalties, \n* Criminal penalties. \n\nThese repercussions depend on the gravity of the violation. According to [HIPAA Answers](https://www.hipaanswers.com/hipaa-violation-penalties/), there are four violation categories: \n\n1. A violation that was not known and could not have been realistically avoided. \n2. A violation that the responsible parties should have been aware of but could not have been avoided. \n3. A violation due to negligence, where correction attempts were made to correct it. \n4. A violation due to negligence, with no attempts made to correct it. \n\nThe **financial penalties** are also split into four categories: \n\n1. Minimum fine of $128 per violation up to $63,973, \n2. Minimum fine of $1,280 per violation up to $63,973, \n3. Minimum fine of $12,794 per violation up to $63,973, \n4. Minimum fine of $63,973 per violation up to $1,919,173. \n\n**Criminal penalties** are divided into three categories: \n\n* For reasonable cause or no knowledge of the violation: up to one year in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI under false pretenses: up to five years in jail, \n* For obtaining PHI for personal gain or malicious attempt: up to ten years in jail. \n\n## HIPAA Compliance in the Cloud: A Checklist \n\nAfter we've understood the importance of compliance with HIPAA, let's see the requirements that need to be fulfilled. They are grouped into three categories: \n\n* Technical Safeguards, \n* Administrative Safeguards, \n* Physical Safeguards.  \n\nLet’s look at them more in detail and understand how Cyscale can help you become compliant with HIPAA. \n\n### 1. Technical Safeguards \n\nTechnical Safeguards are split into four categories. We will also show you examples of controls in Cyscale to help you understand how easy it is to implement them and streamline the process of becoming compliant. \n\n* Access control – only authorized entities should access ePHI. \n* Audit control – access to ePHI should be recorded and examined. \n* Integrity – ePHI should not be altered or destroyed by unauthorized individuals. \n* Transmission security – ePHI should be safely transmitted over the network. \n\nExamples of controls for some of these safeguards are: \n\n* **Access control:** *Ensure network access rule for storage bucket is not set to publicly accessible* for Alibaba Cloud. \n* **Audit control:** *Ensure that Object-level logging for write events is enabled for S3 bucket* for AWS. \n* **Transmission security:** *Ensure 'Enforce SSL connection' is set to 'ENABLED' for MySQL Database Server* for Azure. \n\n### 2. Administrative Safeguards \n\n* **Security Management Process** – analyze potential risks and take protective measures, \n* **Security Personnel** – a security officer should be responsible for security policies and procedures, \n* **Information Access Management** – limit access to PHI to [the minimum necessary](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), \n* **Workforce Training and Management** – employees should receive training in PHI management and be supervised, \n* **Evaluation** – a periodic assessment of security policies should be performed. \n\nTwo examples of controls for the “Information Access Management” Safeguard are: \n\n* *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created* for AWS \n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n\n### 3. Physical Safeguards \n\n* **Facility Access and Control** – access to a covered entity's facilities should be limited to authorized personnel, \n* **Workstation and Device Security** – policies and procedures should be implemented to regulate the usage and access to workstations and devices.  \n\nUse Cyscale to achieve compliance with HIPAA and other international standards. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","seoTitle":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","description":"We have released a new, powerful Data Security Dashboard to provide visibility in the cloud.

The Dashboard displays information about: \n\n* Encryption, \n* The management of cryptographic keys, \n* Publicly accessible storage assets such as VMs, databases, [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/), and others, \n* Databases and misconfigurations related to them, \n* Containers such as blobs and buckets that may vulnerable, and others. \n\nThese DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities enable users to detect attack paths for data storage assets and quickly mitigate them.  \n\nThe first section of the dashboard shows us the percentage of storage assets that are:  \n\n* unencrypted,  \n* encrypted with provider-managed-key, and  \n* encrypted with CMK (Customer Managed Key).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-3.jpg\" alt=\"Progress card for encryption status\" title=\"Progress card for encryption status\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nThis card is a good indicator of progress, and, by clicking on each section of the status bar, we see which assets fit in each of those states. Using this feature, you are at a click away from finding out which of your storage cloud assets are unencrypted. \n\nThe next section contains the Publicly Accessible card, which provides visibility over a multitude of assets, as you can see in the image below. When you click on each element, you see a list of affected assets, along with the associated risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" title=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at this feature in more detail to understand how this helps secure your cloud infrastructure. \n\nThe “**Readable Object Containers**” and “**Writable Object Containers**” refer to storage assets such as [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) and blobs. Object containers should not be publicly accessible unless it is necessary, since individuals could then read or overwrite possibly sensitive data without having to perform any kind of authentication or authorization. \n\nThe next item in this section highlights **database instances that have public IP addresses**. Databases should be configured with private IP addresses to reduce attack surface and increase security. \n\nThe last items in this list are publicly accessible: \n\n* **queues**,  \n* **encryption keys**, and  \n* **disks**.  \n\n[Cloud queues](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-queues-security-best-practices/) act like buffers to prevent data loss when services are too busy and cannot process incoming messages, and therefore should not be publicly accessible to prevent data leakage or data tampering. The control regarding encryption keys checks for attached policies that may allow public access to the key. The other control ensures there are no disks attached to VMs reachable from the internet. \n\nThe next card on the Data Security Dashboard provides an overview of the [encryption keys](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) used in your cloud infrastructure. Cryptographic key management is a very important but sometimes overlooked aspect of the encryption process.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-4.jpg\" alt=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" title=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nCyscale checks if the encryption keys are stored on a vulnerable VM or if they have a permissive access policy to identify possible attack paths. Moreover, important information is highlighted, such as: \n\n* keys that are in use and are scheduled for deletion, \n* keys that haven’t been rotated in a long time, and \n* keys that will expire soon. \n\nThe next two sections in this dashboard focus on object containers, such as buckets or blobs, and on [databases](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/). Here, you can see some of the categories of vulnerabilities Cyscale has identified and checked your cloud environment against.  \n\nThe first card presents the state of your object containers. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"Object containers with issues\" title=\"Object containers with issues\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUsing this feature, we identify attack paths that may compromise your cloud assets and help you solve them. \n\nFor example, a common attack is exploiting VMs that have open management ports. If you have a VM that has permissions on a bucket, and that VM is compromised, your bucket may be compromised as well.  \n\nUsing the [Cyscale Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/), you can see that the VM named \"sql-instance\" has an instance profile that gives it full access to the bucket on the far right, and the VM also has port 22 (SSH) open. The VM is thus connected to the internet and therefore puts the data stored in the bucket at risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-6.jpg\" alt=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph highlighting an attack path\" title=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nOther critical issues highlighted for object containers include: \n\n* Enabling public access to storage assets, \n* Having an overly-permissive access policy,  \n* Not enabling versioning, and others. \n\nClicking on “Object containers with public access”, we get a list of misconfigured assets as well as details like: \n\n* Connectors, which represents the cloud or identity provider account, \n* Tags,  \n* Risks. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-7.jpg\" alt=\"List of misconfigured assets\" title=\"List of misconfigured assets\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nMoving on to the databases card, using controls, Cyscale checks for the following misconfigurations: \n\n* **Databases with public IP addresses,** \n* **Databases with outdated engine versions,** \n* **Databases without deletion protection,** \n* **Databases with no encryption,** \n* **Databases with no/old TLS.** \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-5.jpg\" alt=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" title=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUse the multitude of features present in the Cyscale Data Security Dashboard to eliminate data exposure through [data storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/).

Following security best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its environments.  \n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your cloud security posture. \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies security requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation. \n\nOur [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/)  can help you secure your cloud environment and become compliant with respected accreditations through: \n\n* Over 400 controls that help you stay on top of your security program, \n* Both pre-configured and editable policies that can be associated to controls, \n* Powerful identity and security dashboards for enhanced visibility over your cloud infrastructure, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Compliance","CSPM"],"title":"The New ISO 27001 2022 Version, Explained for the Cloud","seoTitle":"The New ISO 27001 2022 Version, Explained for the Cloud","description":"In October 2022, the new ISO 27001:2022 was released.

This version is bringing considerable changes to the old [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/). Let's examine them and understand what they might mean to your company.  \n\n## The Changes \n\n### 1. The structure of the standard has changed. \n\nInstead of 14 clauses in Annex A that categorized the controls, ISO 27001:2022 groups all controls into four themes: \n\n* People (8 controls), \n* Organizational (37 controls), \n* Technological (34 controls),  \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\n### 2. Some controls have been merged or renamed. \n\nISO 27001:2022 contains 93 controls, instead of 114. Let’s look at examples of controls that have been modified: \n\n1. **A.18.1.1** Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements, and \n2. **A.18.1.5** Regulation of cryptographic controls. \n\nHave been merged into: \n\n1. **A.5.31** Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. \n\nA control that remained the same but has been moved to a different section is: \n\n> **A.18.1.2 Intellectual property rights.**  \n\nIt has been modified to: \n\n> **A.5.32 Intellectual property rights.** \n\n### 3. New controls have been added \n\nBelow, you can see the list of the 11 new controls added to Annex A of the ISO 27001:2022 standard. \n\n1. Threat intelligence (A.5.7) \n2. Information security for the use of cloud services (A.5.23) \n3. ICT readiness for business continuity (A.5.30) \n4. Physical security monitoring (A.7.4) \n5. Configuration management (A.8.9) \n6. Information deletion (A.8.10) \n7. Data masking (A.8.11) \n8. Data leakage prevention (A.8.12) \n9. Monitoring activities (A.8.16) \n10. Web filtering (A.8.23) \n11. Secure coding (A.8.28) \n\nA notable control is 5.23, “Information security for the use of cloud services”, since now, cloud security has a dedicated control. This preventative control is designed to keep risk at a minimum and regulate the management and usage of cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. This control covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n\n### 4. Controls have attributes \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001-and-iso27002-2022-updates), controls can now be categorized based on 5 different attributes, with the mentioned values: \n\n* **Control type** (preventive, detective, corrective) \n* **Information security properties** (confidentiality, integrity, availability) \n* **Cybersecurity concepts** (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover) \n* **Operational capabilities** (governance, asset management, etc.) \n* **Security domains** (governance and ecosystem, protection, defense, resilience) \n\nUsing these attributes, your company can organize the controls based on their scope. \n\n## What does this mean to a CISO? \n\nThe [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) certification has a three-year validity, and the old version of the standard will be valid until it expires. Therefore, companies have a three-year period to recertify and become compliant with the new version of ISO 27001. This means that, at the latest, companies must recertify before the 31st of October 2025.  \n\nThe process of obtaining the [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) certification is time-consuming and difficult. However, you can make this task easier with Cyscale. \n\nCyscale helps you become compliant with international standards by providing hundreds of controls that help you secure your cloud environment, ensure you have implemented the requirements for international standards, and also aid you when going through audits. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","seoTitle":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","description":"Serverless computing is a collection of services provided by cloud vendors.

It allows users to write and execute code in the cloud without setting up the environment and allocating resources such as VMs beforehand. \n\nBenefits of serverless computing are: \n\n* **A pay-as-you-go model**, allowing code to only run when needed, \n* **No server management required**, since your code is running in the cloud, and you don't have to deal with the environment settings, \n* **Granular updates and patches** that allow developers to make changes at function-level and quickly deploy new versions, \n* **High reliability applications**, since the code runs on the cloud. \n\n## Services offered by cloud vendors \n\nTo further understand what serverless computing has to offer, we must look at services on the market and their features.  \n\n### 1. AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate \n\n**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that allows users, through functions, to run event-driven code without server provisioning or management. AWS Lambda can be used for: \n\n* File processing, \n* Stream processing, \n* Web and mobile applications, \n* IoT backends, and others. \n\nThe event-driven flows help reduce costs for users and add flexibility. Lambda functions are triggered by events, and customers only pay for the time the code is running.  \n\nMoreover, when creating a Lambda function, you can either start writing a function from scratch, or use sample code such as Amazon’s blueprints or the AWS Serverless Application Repository to implement your desired code. \n\n**AWS Fargate** is a compute engine that provides a serverless solution for application deployment by removing the need for infrastructure management. \n\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a service that allows Kubernetes instances to run both in the cloud and on-premises. EKS, together with AWS Fargate, produce a serverless solution for containers. \n\nFargate can also be used with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), with no additional changes required for your applications. \n\n### 2. Azure Serverless  \n\nMicrosoft Azure offers a collection of serverless compute solutions. Just like AWS Lambda, Azure Serverless enables its users to deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nSome of the Azure compute services are: \n\n* **Serverless Functions.** Just like AWS Lambda, Azure allows users to write event-driven code in their preferred language. Costs are applied only when the code is being executed, \n* **Serverless Kubernetes.** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), together with AKS virtual nodes, provide a serverless solution that reduces the infrastructure management workload of Kubernetes clusters. \n* **Serverless Containerized Microservices.** With this solution, applications are deployed in containers without managing the infrastructure,  \n* **Serverless Application Environments.** Using Azure App Service, web, mobile, and API applications are hosted in a fully managed environment.  \n\nAzure also provides low-code or no-code application development with Power Apps. This feature allows developers to construct applications using drag-and-drop functionalities, connectors, and readily-available solutions for common use cases. \n\n### 3. Cloud Run and Cloud Functions by GCP \n\nThese two solutions offered by GCP provide serverless compute services.  \n\n**Cloud Run** is an application development tool that separates infrastructure management from the code by placing applications in containers. Using Cloud Run, microservices can be deployed without specific configurations. It is highly scalable, and it can scale to zero – this means that if a service has no requests, all containers are removed, reducing costs. It supports the following programming languages: Go, Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, as well as others. \n\n**Cloud Functions** is a similar service to AWS Lambda and Azure Serverless. \n\n## Possible vulnerabilities of serverless computing \n\n### 1. Lack of source code security \n\nMany cyber attacks are successful due to poor code security.  \n\nAccording to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), one of the most common attacks on web applications in 2022 was SQL Injection. Whether an application is hosted in the cloud or not, user input should always be treated very carefully. \n\nTo correctly handle data received from users, you should sanitize it correctly and use prepared statements. \n\n### 2. Outdated or unpatched libraries, packages, and dependencies \n\nAnother element that affects applications' security is the libraries, packages, technologies, and dependencies used.  \n\nIn 2021, a critical vulnerability was discovered. Log4j, a popular Java framework used for logging messages in applications, introduced a massive flaw: it allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host machine. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as Log4Shell, [affected around 3 billion devices](https://www.acaglobal.com/insights/log4shell-vulnerability-what-we-know-and-action-steps-take).   \n\nServerless functions in the cloud were not immune to this attack. The functions written in Java that were using Log4j were vulnerable to Log4Shell. \n\nWhile not having to deal with underlying infrastructure management is an advantage of serverless computing, technologies used by developers still have to be used safely. \n\nHow do you protect your code from such vulnerabilities? \n\n* Only use trusted libraries, \n* Apply updates and patches as they appear, \n* Continuously assess your code, \n* Remove any unnecessary dependencies. \n\n### 3. Monitor your cloud infrastructure \n\nThis measure is a given. Log and monitor what your applications do to identify any odd behavior.  \n\nDocument every event that interacts with your code and see how your applications respond.  \n\n### 4. Integrate cryptography into your code \n\n[Encrypt sensitive data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) to ensure confidentiality in your applications’ flow. You should encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest data using AES. \n\nMoreover, safely store secrets and keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or in your cloud using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault,  \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in GCP. \n\nDo not store keys, connection strings, or passwords in the source code or in plain text. \n\n### 5. Too much information is disclosed in error messages. \n\nWe’ve all encountered verbose error messages. \n\nDevelopers should not disclose information about errors or exceptions to the user. Instead, they should be handled in the code, and the message displayed should offer minimal explanations without revealing why the error occurred. \n\n  \n\nWhile writing code in the cloud and quickly deploying it without infrastructure management is tempting, you should be careful.  \n\nImplement the best practices recommended in this article to address serverless computing vulnerabilities and secure your cloud environment. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8d4c6d8bbaf7d15683610dbc9b7fd89d/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/8d4c6d8bbaf7d15683610dbc9b7fd89d/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8d4c6d8bbaf7d15683610dbc9b7fd89d/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","4068871638","4109069157"]}
