Up until now, cloud professionals were talking about three main security solutions: [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).\n\nBut recently, Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform. CNAPP combines the capabilities of Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) to provide comprehensive [cloud native application security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) across development and production environments.\n\nThe legitimate question would be: ***Why do I need another security tool?***\n\nWell, the idea is to focus not only on your [cloud infrastructure's security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) configurations but also on your applications that run in the cloud.\n\nYou could argue that your CWPP or your CSPM is already doing something about this - and you would be right!\n\nIf you dig deeper, CNAPP is basically a mix of 2 separate solutions:  Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) & Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)\n\n### What is CSPM?\n\n[Cloud Security Posture Management solutions (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) have as main purpose the [detection of misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). They will continuously monitor the cloud environment in order to provide visibility across multi-cloud and alert the company about compliance drift or risky behavior. CSPMs focus on cloud infrastructure.\n\n### What is CWPP?\n\nCloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs) are designed to protect the workloads deployed in the cloud. They will perform vulnerability assessments and handle the security of the applications. Based on assessment results, you can implement security controls or you can remediate the threats. CWPPs focus on the applications running in the cloud.\n\n## **Which is better? CNAPP vs CSPM+CWPP**\n\nThe increasing features overlap between these two solutions will make this \"merge\" inevitable.\n\n You can still use separate tools, or you can try a CNAPP, that's entirely up to you.\n\n#### ***Advantages of using CNAPP:***\n\n* better visibility and control of cloud-native application risk (when using separate tools, the identification and remediation actions can be fragmented, and not as efficient as having it all in one tool)\n* better collaboration for development and operations teams\n* simpler CI/CD pipelines (reduced complexity and cost since fewer tools are involved)\n* it scans all the source code, containers, VM images, IaC scripts, API\n\n#### ***Advantages of using separate tools:***\n\nThe most important one is the *maturity of the tools*.\n\nYou need to consider that Gartner expects this new category to have a high impact, but also predicts that it will take five to ten years before CNAPP is established in regular use.\n\nSince this is a new category of products, the market for CNAPP has just started to evolve and vendors need time to integrate all these capabilities.\n\nCWPP vendors have started to add new features capabilities, including IaC scanning.\n\nSome CSPMs have cutting edge-technology in place and can already give you some of the features promised a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/).\n\nThis is the case of [Cyscale Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com), the solution that offers advanced visibility, but more importantly, gives you context so you can better prioritize.\\\nThe [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/)™ built within the platform may reveal, for example, that one of the resources usually reported to have a high-security risk, is not as vulnerable as it seems. (Let's think about a VM that has unencrypted disks attached, but is not being used in a production environment, or is not externally accessible from the internet).\\\nThis type of approach can make you realize that you need a more advanced risk analysis and a look beyond the classic list of logs, where the vulnerable components are reported without taking into consideration the bigger picture.\n\nRegardless of your choice of tool, just remember to give security posture the importance it deserves.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"CSPM: A Comprehensive Guide","seoTitle":"CSPM: A Comprehensive Guide - Cyscale","description":"A Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the unintentional risks that can expose your data. \nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility.

Something had to be done, and fast!\n\nThe Cybersecurity market responded with innovation, and so a new security category was born: the *Cloud Infrastructure Security Posture Assessment.*\n\nThe main objective of tools in this category was to report configuration errors discovered in the rapidly changing environment that is the cloud.\n\nAs the products quickly evolved and gained in complexity, the initial name was changed to [***CSPM*** - or ***Cloud Security Posture Management***](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), but the main purpose of the solutions remained the same: to monitor the cloud infrastructure, [identify potential misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and help with security policy enforcement.\n\nIn this age of rapid technological advances, it's crucial to recognize the ever-evolving [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/). With the digital landscape shifting constantly, businesses face new threats and vulnerabilities. It's against this backdrop that the importance and necessity of solutions like CSPM become even more evident.\n\nIncluded in Gartner's “Top 10 Security Projects for 2019”, the CSPM represents one of the most important technologies that leaders should invest in when using cloud or multi-cloud infrastructures.\n\n## When to choose a CSPM and when not to\n\nA Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the **unintentional risks** that can expose your data.\n\nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility. Regardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches and possibly data leakage.\n\n### Misconfigurations - cause and effect\n\nWe've all heard about major breaches that happened because of AWS S3 buckets being publicly accessible. (This exact [misconfiguration happened to Romania's largest real estate portal](https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach\") ).\n\nMany cloud application creators or maintainers don't believe this can happen to them, but, for example, when new virtual machines are launched in a hurry by a less experienced DevOps engineer, mistakes can occur and networks that should have been private are now public and exposed.\n\nOther common misconfigurations that attackers are often exploiting are overprivileged credentials. Restricting users' access to data and resources to only what is strictly required for them to do their jobs is a must, in other words, you need to use the **least privilege principle**.\n\nThe [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) will report and advise against using overly permissive account settings for your users, and at the same time remind you to use encryption, thus strengthening your security and making it even harder for an unauthorized or malicious individual to access and expose your data.\n\nThe advanced CSPM solutions we see these days offer continuous monitoring, risk assessments, remediation recommendations based on security best practices, and assistance for compliance with the most common security frameworks and standards.\n\nWhat if you could have a powerful solution that offers full visibility over your cloud accounts, enabling better communication and collaboration between your Security team, the DevOps, and the Compliance team?\n\nThis solution exists! You need to implement a CSPM to improve your cloud security posture and to build a strong Security Program.\n\nUnlike other security software which takes a lot of time to set up, requiring multiple steps to achieve proper installation and configuration, a CSPM platform is agentless. To have it up and running takes only minutes and best of all, it has no negative impact in your infrastructure's performance.\n\nThe scan of your cloud account infrastructure will start immediately after onboarding and the results, meaning the identified issues and security risks will be displayed, usually ranked by severity or risk score.\n\n## Take advantage of the extra visibility\n\nA CSPM will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure, making it easy to prioritize the order and urgency of solving these issues.\n\nYour cloud infrastructure is not a one-way road, cloud assets are interconnected, and it is critical to understand how this can lead to exposed resources.\n\nThe complete cloud assets inventory will automatically be compared against a set of best practices.\n\nHaving full visibility is key when implementing security best practices.\n\nManaging your cloud assets from a single dashboard is an important and useful feature.\n\nYour Security team is responsible for monitoring the cloud against threats, possible attacks, or malicious behavior. Your DevOps team is rapidly building and deploying applications in the cloud (and therefore adding new cloud assets), while your Compliance and Auditing team needs to make sure the company and its cloud infrastructure stay compliant with regulations and standards. What a dedicated solution such as a CSPM does for you, is to make sure that the relevant information is available to each of these teams in an easily comprehensible manner.\n\n## Better security for your cloud environments with the CSPM solution\n\nSome cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform have security recommendations in place, however, you need to understand that they apply only to that specific cloud provider and in many cases, they turn out to be false positives, since the context is not taken into consideration.\n\nNot to mention that a multi-cloud strategy will complicate security efforts since IT security teams must deal with the fact that configuration is different from one cloud provider to the other.\n\nCSPM solutions do not require the deployment of any additional resources to enforce cloud security best practices and will identify and help mitigate these security risks across cloud providers.\n\nAccording to Gartner, CSPM tools can identify risks in the configurations of your [cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) and will immediately react either with automatic remediations or with specific instructions on how to fix the misconfiguration and eliminate risks.\n\nThere are other types of tools that handle sensitive workloads and data in the cloud or that monitor user activity. All these tools are enforcing security policies and together they can ensure the proper protection in the cloud.\n\nSolutions such as Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) can have similar features with a CSPM.\n\nCASB software, for example, was created to monitor and enforce enterprise security, and it is not necessarily cloud-based. It can be installed on-premise, placed between cloud applications and their users acting as a central gateway that controls users' access to the cloud. It includes DLP (Data Loss Prevention) capabilities, Governance, Data encryption, MDM (Mobile Device Management).\n\nCWPP comprises agent-based solutions that offer visibility and security management for workloads. So, the provided inventory mainly covers VMs (Virtual Machines), public cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service), and container-based application architectures. A CWPP solution does not provide event monitoring outside workloads.\n\nEven if CASB, CWPP, and CSPM may sound similar at first, their scope and coverage are different, as they represent different categories. You will need to decide which tool or tools are the right ones for your organization.\n\n## Compliance controls across your environment in the cloud\n\nCompanies that closely follow regulatory compliance are using Cloud Security Posture Management tools to avoid breaches that usually ruin the brand reputation and bring monetary fines to the company.\n\nA CSPM solution can offer predefined Policies needed for compliance with the most common benchmarks and regulations such as CIS, NIST, HIPPA, ISO27001, or others.\n\nConsidering the compliance aspect, you could be tempted to believe that a CSPM solution is just another GRC tool (Governance Risk and Compliance), but in reality, it is more than that.\n\nUsing CSPM software, you can get a grip on your cloud compliance strategy in just a couple of steps:\n\n**Start by identifying the applicable standards for your company.**\n\nUsually, you will find a specific section in the platform where the most common standards and regulations are defined and implemented from a cloud security perspective. PCI-DSS, NIST, GDPR, CIS, ISO, HIPPA - are just some examples of what you can expect to find.\n\n**Next, you will determine the requirements and start documenting your compliance processes.**\n\nPredefined compliance policies are offered, but you will be able to define custom ones, specific to your needs. Policies have technical controls attached that are automatically assessed. In case of a failed assessment, remediation actions are suggested.\n\nA CSPM solution can be a powerful reporting and evidence collection tool, making it easy to always be prepared for audits and inspections.\n\nWhen it comes to defining Policies and Procedures for the governance of your organization — for example, Access Management Policy, Change Management Policy, and so on — Cyscale's solution offers these out-of-the-box and you can use them as baselines, customizable to your needs.\n\n**The last but very important step is to monitor changes and configuration drifts.**\n\nThis is when the ongoing monitoring capability of the CSPM software comes in handy. Once you define your set of policies, the solution will help identify compliance drifts.\n\nYour Compliance Officers can use the CSPM as an in-house audit tool, assisting them in preparing for externally conducted or formal compliance audits.\n\nA CSPM tool will help you handle compliance concerns, minimize threats, catch errors and empower you to align [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) across the company.\n\nWhen you are looking for a CSPM solution, keep in mind that visibility and context go hand in hand and that Cyscale Cloud Platform can offer the most comprehensive context thanks to its unique Security Knowledge Graph™.\n\nAs Gartner stated: “the use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. So, although, there are cases when a CSPM solution's functionalities can overlap with those of other security tools, it could never be fully replaced by any of them.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*Photo by [Hal Gatewood](https://unsplash.com/@halacious?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":36,"numPages":5,"currentPage":5,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["CSPM","News","Product","Compliance","CNAPP","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
