If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for Google Cloud. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies","seoTitle":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies - Cyscale","description":"A CSPM product is a component of cloud security that uses controls to identify misconfigurations, sends targeted alerts to companies, provides step on how to remediate findings and helps you achieve compliance with international standards. 5 best practices and strategies are: ensure visibility of assets, classify assets and prioritize the most important ones, achieve compliance with international standards, monitor your infrastructure and ensure logging, remediate findings quickly.

Ensure visibility of assets\n\nIf you have a large number of assets, it is challenging to guarantee discovery and visibility and to find security design issues. \n\nBroad visibility and discovery of assets may help you identify: \n\n* misconfigurations that may cause vulnerabilities in your system, \n* poor access control, \n* weak data security, and others. \n\nBelow, you can see a section of Cyscale’s powerful dashboard, where you can also find the status of your controls, alerts, and others. \n\nThis inventory helps you keep track of assets and be aware of the different components in your cloud environment. \n\n![Dashboard inventory in Cyscale](/img/inventory-dashboard.webp#shadow \"Dashboard inventory in Cyscale\")\n\n#### 2. Classify assets and prioritize the most important ones\n\nAsset classification is very important; it will help you prioritize the assets with high risk and high importance. \n\nA company's security can be considerably improved by categorizing assets according to their risk and by setting remediation priorities. \n\n#### 3. Achieve compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and others.\n\nA CSPM can help you achieve compliance by: \n\nensuring your cloud environment is implementing requirements and best practices,  \n\nproviding evidence of your organization’s efforts and speeding up the auditing process. \n\nThere is a long list of international standards that regulate configurations of cloud environments: \n\n* ISO 27001,  \n* GDPR,  \n* HIPAA, \n* PCI-DSS, \n* NIST, and many more. \n\n![International compliance standards](/img/standards.webp#shadow \"International compliance standards\")\n\n#### 4. Monitor your infrastructure\n\nIdentifying threats early is crucial to preventing incidents. Keep logs and document every action and event to be able to respond to threats as they appear. \n\nMonitoring and logging your infrastructure can help you: \n\n* notice odd behavior, \n* identify misconfigurations, \n* provide accountability for employees’ and customers’ actions. \n\n#### 5. Remediate findings quickly\n\nSolving misconfigurations and responding to incidents promptly is essential – it can prevent a threat from becoming a breach.  \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are:  \n\n* implementing strong encryption for sensitive data, \n* eliminating administrator or root accounts that are not necessary, \n* using access lists and policies to restrict unwanted traffic. \n\nA CSPM can help you remediate failed controls and quickly patch your systems. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that can help you implement the best practices described in this article and even more. You can use over 400 controls and powerful dashboards to: \n\n* obtain visibility and discovery of your cloud environment, \n* manage high priority assets, \n* identify misconfigurations in a timely manner, \n* ensure compliance with international standards, \n* solve findings and ensure security.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

PII can be used with or without other data to identify an individual. \n\nExamples of Personally Identifiable Information are: \n\n* name, \n* social security number, \n* biometric records, \n* unique personal document numbers such as passport or driver’s license number, \n* medical, educational, financial history, and many others. \n\nPII information can be categorized into two parts: \n\n1. Linked information. This type of data can on its own single out an individual. \n2. Unlinked information. A person cannot be directly traced based on it, but if combined with another piece of information it could identify an individual. Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Securing Your Technology Stack ","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Securing Your Technology Stack ","description":"An article about cloud native security.

It is developed and deployed in the cloud in its entirety.  \n\nThis type of application is containerized, for example in Docker or Kubernetes, to ensure isolated, dependency-free environments, and most of the time uses microservices to divide tasks and provide granularity.  \n\n**Cloud-based applications** are built and run outside the cloud but have certain features integrated into the cloud. \n\nA **cloud-enabled or non-native application** is originally meant for an on-premises environment. It is built outside the cloud and later transferred into one, in order to enjoy some of its benefits. \n\n<div id=\"advantages\">\n\n## Advantages of going cloud-native\n\n</div>\n\nTo better understand the differences between cloud-native and on-premises apps that do not use cloud, we will look at the former’s advantages and disadvantages over the latter’s.\n\n### Speed \n\nNative applications are easier and faster to build and deploy than on-premises ones because no sophisticated software or hardware requirements need to be fulfilled. Moreover, updates are also implemented faster in a cloud-native architecture and require no downtime.\n\n### Cost \n\nThe cost of using cloud-native technology depends on the application but is generally lower since it does not require the purchase of expensive hardware. For example, instead of buying a computer, you use virtual machines.\n\nTypically, cloud-native applications only require software licenses or subscriptions. \n\n### Scalability \n\nSince cloud-native environments do not require hardware upgrades, they are scalable and adaptable to business requirements. \n\nAccording to [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation), an open source project, “cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications”. \n\n### Resiliency \n\nThe cloud is known for its resiliency against natural disasters, power outages and other incidents that may disrupt a cloud-enabled application. Native cloud workloads are therefore more resilient. \n\n### A serverless model \n\nCloud-native applications may work on a serverless model by leaving the provisioning and maintaining tasks to the cloud provider. This model simplifies the deployment steps and eases the developer's work, increasing productivity. \n\nMoreover, using this model, cloud-native applications can be launched only when needed, the code in serverless functions responding to triggers and consuming resources when necessary. An advantage is that costs are reduced for applications. \n\n<div id=\"guide-to-secure-cloud\">\n\n## How to secure your cloud-native application\n\n</div>\n\nAccording to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/), cloud-native security can be approached in 4 layers, called the 4 C’s: \n\n1. Code, \n2. Container, \n3. Cluster, \n4. Cloud. \n\n### Code \n\nThe inner layer of security refers to the code; it is the part the application’s developer has the most control over, yet it can be one of a hacker's most appealing attack surfaces. \n\nApplication code security is usually an underrated cybersecurity mechanism and neglecting it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Here are a few security practices for securing code: \n\n* **Sanitize input.** This can go a long way and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others. \n* **Use encryption.** Data at rest and data in transit should always be encrypted. Make sure you’re sending application data encrypted through TLS. \n* **Ensure modern cryptography.** Even if you’re using encryption and hashing, make sure that: \n\n  * You’re not using deprecated algorithms, such as DES for encryption and MD5 for hashing, Instead, use AES and SHA-256 or newer, which are the current standards. \n  * You’re storing cryptographic keys safely (and not in the source code). \n  * You’re rotating keys regularly to safeguard against brute-force attacks on them. \n* **Only open the ports you’re using.** Don’t forget open ports, especially on internet-facing applications. This is one of the ways attackers can gain access to the cloud infrastructure and infect it with malware. \n\n### Container \n\nThe next layer of security for native cloud is controlled at the container level. \n\nContainers are virtualization tools which allow you to run applications in isolated environments, separated from the hardware.  \n\nIf your application uses various technologies, you can install any needed packages and resolve dependencies in the container instead of on the host operating system. \n\nAnother useful feature of containers is that you can create container image templates and replicate environments without having to re-install tools and technologies. \n\nThe most known containerization services are Docker and Kubernetes.  \n\nDocker is a platform that enables developers to deploy applications in a containerized environment. Docker runs over a single node (machine), while Kubernetes is a container orchestration service. \n\nDocker and Kubernetes are usually seen as competitors, but they work very well together; Kubernetes can help manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. \n\nHowever, there are a few security issues that need to be addressed regarding containers security: \n\n* **Do not run containers as root.** Developers find it easier to run containers as root because they don't have to provide their password when executing an action that requires root privileges. However, this opens up a wide palette of vulnerabilities; any attacker that would gain access to the container would have root privileges and, therefore, the highest level of permissions. \n* **Reduce the attack surface.** If an attacker gains access to the container, make sure they cannot escalate their privileges or escape the container; eliminate the use of UNIX binaries that can be used to bypass rules, such as \"sed\" and \"awk\". \n* **Implement a strong network policy**—for example, filter traffic to and from the container and use firewalls to ensure robust security. \n\n### Cluster \n\nThe third layer for cloud-native security is managed in clusters. \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It comprises the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining for example which application is running in which container. \n\nThe nodes that are part of a cluster run the applications. \n\nLet’s understand how to protect clusters with the following security solutions:\n\n* **Implement Authentication.** This step requires the user to prove they are who they claim to be. The authentication process may be different from service to service, but it can require credentials like passwords, client certificates, tokens, and others. \n* **Implement Authorization.** Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes authorization by assigning roles to users and managing their privileges at role level to ensure application security. \n* **Control what privileges containers run with.** Establish permissions by using security contexts. These are settings that can be applied to a container or a set of containers inside a cluster that define privileges and access control. \n\n### Cloud \n\nThe outer layer of a cloud-native application refers to cloud infrastructure and configuration.

So, let's see how you can do it.\n\n## What is the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is a data model based on deep understanding that maps cloud assets and their relationships, as well as information from adjacent data sources to provide context-aware security and deliver a comprehensive security analysis over an organization. \n\n**Google uses a Knowledge Graph** to power the results of its search engine by keeping a database of billions of records. \n\nThat is how [Google](https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176?hl=en) is able to answer questions accurately with context. \n\nThe Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™ is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between all of your cloud assets, as well as other apps and systems that may affect cloud security posture, and automatically pinpoints security issues.  \n\nThe graph is more than just a way to visualize assets and systems; it uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities. \n\n## Why use a Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nYou could go through sets of configuration best practices and verify them against each cloud resource.  \n\nHowever, when looked at in isolation, a resource may be misconfigured, but the relations it has with other assets, as well as its position in the network (for example, if it’s in a private network or if it is Internet-facing) may greatly influence the criticality of the situation. \n\nThe Security Knowledge Graph™ is built on top of a graph database that contains nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns to create comprehensive graphs. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a Security Knowledge Graph™.  \n\nNotice how a very complex system with intricate relationships and hidden vulnerabilities is so much easier to understand and observe when looking at it in a graph. \n\n![The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](/img/2-general.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n## Are you unsure if you need the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nLet me show you why you do!  \n\nRead the following scenarios to see if you can find your company in any of the situations described.  \n\n### Scenario 1: HR and identity providers \n\nAn employee joins the company and is onboarded using an HR management tool, such as BambooHR or Workday. \n\nAn account is created for the employee using an identity provider such as [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/), through which they receive access to a production [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) account, GitHub, and many other sensitive applications that may end up having an effect on the company's cloud infrastructure. \n\nWhen the employee leaves the company, they are offboarded from the HR portal, and the human resources department thinks the employee's accounts were completely deprovisioned.  \n\nHowever, since the Okta administrator did not correctly deprovision his account, the former employee **still has access to production code**. \n\n![HR and identity providers scenario in a graph](/img/3-scenariu-1.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 2: Misconfigured permissions \n\nIt is not uncommon to have employees with very similar names within the same company. For example, assume user John Smith, a software developer, and Jonathan Smith, an accountant, are both employees at the same company. \n\nThey are mistaken for one another and instead of John, the software developer, it is Jonathan who receives the credentials instead, thus gaining access to a sensitive account.  \n\nWhile trying to understand the reasoning behind this, Jonathan explores the account and accidentally **deletes a resource from the cloud**. \n\n![Misconfigured permissions in graph](/img/4-scenariu-2.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 3: False positives in vulnerability scans \n\nA company uses Tenable or CrowdStrike, endpoint vulnerability scanners.  \n\nA virtual machine running an application with Log4J has the Log4Shell vulnerability. As a result, critical alerts are generated, and the software engineers will prioritize this issue over other current vulnerabilities. \n\nHowever, Log4J is only running in a private network, not accessible from the Internet. The issue still needs to be addressed, but the severity is high instead of critical. \n\n**Instead of securing Internet-facing applications and devices, engineers are distracted by less essential tasks** due to contextless alerts. \n\n![False positives in vulnerability scans](/img/5-scenariu-3.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nKeep in mind that these are some examples. There are plenty of other situations where contextual awareness is the best way to notice existing vulnerabilities before they become breaches. \n\n  \n\n[Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) is leading a continuous effort to integrate as many services and tools as possible and expand the Knowledge Graph to cover a great range of security scenarios. \n\nWe currently integrate with: \n\n* AWS (Amazon Web Services), \n* Google Cloud, \n* Microsoft Azure, \n* Alibaba Cloud, \n* Okta, and others. \n\nThere are many more integrations to come soon: AWS SSO, GitHub, Azure AD, Kubernetes, GSuite. \n\n![Integrations in Cyscale](/img/6-tabel.webp#shadow \"Integrations in Cyscale\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","seoTitle":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. Controls in Cyscale check your Okta configurations for the following: if there are at least two Okta admins configured, if application assignments are configured through groups, if MFA is configured and it has strong factors, if there are no weak password policies.","seoDescription":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. It is important to integrate an identity provider with a CSPM to monitor security posture in one single place and see all of your IAM users in context.

If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","seoTitle":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","description":"A CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool is a product that scans your cloud environment for vulnerabilities and alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure.

It alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure. \n\nThis article will discuss what you need to look for in a CSPM and help you make the right choice regarding your [cloud's security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n### Does it check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities? \n\nThere is a long list of possible misconfigurations, policy violations, and mistakes that can disrupt your cloud system. \n\nA good CSPM tool will have controls to check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities and correctly identify any misconfigurations. \n\nSome of [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) are: \n\n* Poor storage access configuration, \n* Broken access control, \n* Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, \n* Missing encryption, \n* Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\n### Does it have an integration with your preferred cloud platform? \n\nThe CSPM tool you choose must be compatible with the cloud platform your system is using. The top three vendors in the cloud industry are: \n\n* [Amazon Web Services Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) \n* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) \n* [Microsoft Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) \n\nWith Cyscale, you can scan and maintain your cloud security posture for all three of the vendors mentioned above, as well as Alibaba Cloud. \n\nAnother essential feature is that Cyscale integrates Okta identities. \n\n### What compliance frameworks does it support? \n\nA certificate of [compliance with a standard such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) can be an asset because it advertises the following things about your company: \n\n* You understand the significance of cybersecurity, \n* Your organization is working to reduce the risk of information security breaches, \n* You are adequately managing information security. \n\nIn order to make the best use of your [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), take into account what compliance standard or certification your company is going for. A few examples are: \n\n* ISO 27001 \n* SOC 2 \n* NIST 800-53 \n* PCI-DSS \n* CIS \n* GDPR \n\nSome standards require you to write your own policies such as Data Protection or Disaster Recovery.  \n\nYou can manage them using traditional tools such as Microsoft Word and Sharepoint, or you can use a powerful policy editor and gain inline evidence collection offered by Cyscale. \n\n### Is the CSPM providing vulnerability and risk scoring? \n\nPrioritization of issues and risk scoring is an essential feature of a CSPM. \n\nAssigning risk levels to assets and prioritizing remediation can significantly increase a company's security. \n\nVulnerability scoring is another essential feature that can help you avoid false positives and prioritize tasks. Time is crucial when discussing vulnerabilities, so quick actions need to be taken to prevent breaches. \n\nThis is why it is essential to ensure that false positives are avoided because they can cause noise that may distract employees from more important matters. \n\n![Alerts divided by severity](/img/alerts-severity.webp#shadow \"Risk scoring in Cyscale\")\n\n### Do you receive targeted alerts? \n\nReceiving thousands of alerts can be overwhelming. Your CSPM tool needs to filter them and send relevant, targeted alerts. \n\nCyscale currently has two types of notifications that can be customized to your preference: \n\n1. Security Posture. These weekly digests show you your cloud security posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count. You can see an example below. \n\n![A Security Posture email showing a posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count](/img/security-posture.webp#shadow \"Security Posture Email from Cyscale\")\n\n2. Alerts. They are sent in batches for a given cloud account in a single email to ensure that they do not become overwhelming. These alerts inform you of new vulnerabilities found in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nBesides these personal notifications sent to your email, you can also enable alerts on Slack, Teams, or an app of your choice, by using Webhook. \n\n### Does it provide remediation for found vulnerabilities? \n\nFinding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure is just the first step. \n\nApplying the correct remediation before it becomes a breach is critical to securing your cloud.  \n\nCyscale provides, along with the controls that pinpoint what vulnerability has been identified, the following: \n\n* an explanation of the cause of the control failure, \n* how the vulnerability was identified, \n* remediation steps. \n\nThe remediation steps can ensure you're applying the modifications correctly and speed up the process of securing your assets. \n\nMake the right decision for your company by using a robust CSPM that helps secure your cloud infrastructure and provides all of the features mentioned above and more. \n\nCyscale ensures the following features: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities, \n* integration with AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, Okta, \n* support for compliance frameworks and standards, \n* prioritization of assets remediation and alerts, \n* targeted and custom alerts, \n* remediation steps and vulnerabilities reports. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 Steps to Improve Your Company’s Cloud Security Posture","seoTitle":"5 Steps to Improve Your Company’s Cloud Security Posture","description":"Improve your company's cloud security posture by assuring discovery and visibility of cloud assets, detecting misconfigurations and applying remediation for them, ensuring logging and monitoring and assuring compliance with security standards.

Assure compliance with security standards \n\nLet us talk more about these tasks and how to accomplish them. \n\n<br/>\n\n**1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets** \n\nLooking at many configurations at once may become overwhelming very fast. \n\nIt is hard to notice flaws in your security design if discovery and visibility are not assured. \n\nDiscovery and visibility in cloud imply being able to visualize cloud assets in an organized and easily readable way, for example in a dashboard.  \n\nEven more useful is when visibility for each asset is enriched by additional context that may be provided in a graph view.\n\n![A graph from the Cyscale application.](/img/graph_image.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nLooking at: \n\n* policies, \n* configurations, \n* connections between assets \n\nin a centralized fashion can help in pointing out: \n\n1. unnecessarily permissive rights \n2. vulnerabilities in your cloud configuration.  \n3. odd changes in your infrastructure. \n\nIt is critical to make sure that visibility is satisfied, in order to enable threat discovery. \n\nFor example, [a graph that maps networks of cloud assets. identities and workloads](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) can help you properly understand relationships, properties, and types of assets in your cloud environment. \n\nVisually examining the characteristics of your infrastructure may aid you in taking the right measures to improve security. \n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Detect misconfigurations** \n\nAccording to [Continuity Central](https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/7117-misconfiguration-was-the-number-one-cause-of-cloud-security-incidents-in-2021), misconfigurations in the cloud environment were the main cause of cloud security breaches in 2021. It is easy to overlook: \n\n* a badly configured access list (ACL) \n* a bad policy for access control \n* an open port that should not be there, and others. \n\nHumans make mistakes. Even a minor misconfiguration that does not impact the activity in your cloud may lead to catastrophic events such as: \n\n* public access to your containers, \n* malware intrusion, \n* lateral movement.  \n\nDiscovering these mistakes before they are exploited is critical.  \n\nIdeally, you should have an automated way to check for common cloud misconfigurations. \n\nWe will provide you with a solution later in this article to easily keep misconfigurations under control and be notified when new ones appear. \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Implement remediation for findings** \n\nIt is not enough to only discover threats in your design. \n\nYou need to also be able to remediate the flaws in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nKnowing how to properly fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is a key factor in improving your cloud security. \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are: \n\n* restricting overly permissive access to users, \n* closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* blocking inbound & outbound traffic. \n\n<br/>\n\n**4. Ensure logging and monitoring** \n\nIt is very important to catch threats before they become incidents.  \n\nA good measure to take is keeping logs and documenting every event that occurs. \n\nIn this case, **targeted alerts** can save your company from disaster by pinpointing: \n\n* misconfigurations \n* suspicious activity \n* attacks coming from outside.  \n\nSpotting threats immediately or within a short period of time may save your cloud environment from being breached. \n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Assure compliance with international standards** \n\nMaking sure that your company is compliant with international standards such as [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/) not only consolidates your data protection services but also shows your clients that you acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity. \n\nFollowing [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) recommended by standards can greatly improve your cloud security posture. \n\nHowever, fulfilling all of the requirements consistently to become compliant with an international standard is a very tedious and time-consuming job. \n\nA solution to this would be automating controls and compliance checks that scan your platform for every requirement and show if you are fulfilling every request. \n\n<br/>\n\nWe have reached the end of the article and now you are probably wondering: \n\n**How do you implement all of the mentioned steps?** \n\nThe tasks described above can be implemented using a [CSPM product (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nCSPM is a component of cloud security that analyzes your cloud environment and alerts you on what controls are failing in your infrastructure. \n\nYour cloud security posture would be improved significantly and promptly when using a CSPM.  \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions to all of the problems raised in this article. \n\nWith Cyscale, you can: \n\n* get an overview of your assets and configurations, \n* easily manage misconfigurations, \n* receive targeted and precise alerts, \n* remediate accidents and flaws in your cloud environment faster, \n* become compliant with international standards. \n\nStart automating tasks, make these processes easier for you and generate reliable results, with [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"CSPM: A Comprehensive Guide","seoTitle":"CSPM: A Comprehensive Guide - Cyscale","description":"A Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the unintentional risks that can expose your data. \nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility.

Something had to be done, and fast!\n\nThe Cybersecurity market responded with innovation, and so a new security category was born: the *Cloud Infrastructure Security Posture Assessment.*\n\nThe main objective of tools in this category was to report configuration errors discovered in the rapidly changing environment that is the cloud.\n\nAs the products quickly evolved and gained in complexity, the initial name was changed to [***CSPM*** - or ***Cloud Security Posture Management***](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), but the main purpose of the solutions remained the same: to monitor the cloud infrastructure, [identify potential misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and help with security policy enforcement.\n\nIn this age of rapid technological advances, it's crucial to recognize the ever-evolving [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/). With the digital landscape shifting constantly, businesses face new threats and vulnerabilities. It's against this backdrop that the importance and necessity of solutions like CSPM become even more evident.\n\nIncluded in Gartner's “Top 10 Security Projects for 2019”, the CSPM represents one of the most important technologies that leaders should invest in when using cloud or multi-cloud infrastructures.\n\n## When to choose a CSPM and when not to\n\nA Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the **unintentional risks** that can expose your data.\n\nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility. Regardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches and possibly data leakage.\n\n### Misconfigurations - cause and effect\n\nWe've all heard about major breaches that happened because of AWS S3 buckets being publicly accessible. (This exact [misconfiguration happened to Romania's largest real estate portal](https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach\") ).\n\nMany cloud application creators or maintainers don't believe this can happen to them, but, for example, when new virtual machines are launched in a hurry by a less experienced DevOps engineer, mistakes can occur and networks that should have been private are now public and exposed.\n\nOther common misconfigurations that attackers are often exploiting are overprivileged credentials. Restricting users' access to data and resources to only what is strictly required for them to do their jobs is a must, in other words, you need to use the **least privilege principle**.\n\nThe [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) will report and advise against using overly permissive account settings for your users, and at the same time remind you to use encryption, thus strengthening your security and making it even harder for an unauthorized or malicious individual to access and expose your data.\n\nThe advanced CSPM solutions we see these days offer continuous monitoring, risk assessments, remediation recommendations based on security best practices, and assistance for compliance with the most common security frameworks and standards.\n\nWhat if you could have a powerful solution that offers full visibility over your cloud accounts, enabling better communication and collaboration between your Security team, the DevOps, and the Compliance team?\n\nThis solution exists! You need to implement a CSPM to improve your cloud security posture and to build a strong Security Program.\n\nUnlike other security software which takes a lot of time to set up, requiring multiple steps to achieve proper installation and configuration, a CSPM platform is agentless. To have it up and running takes only minutes and best of all, it has no negative impact in your infrastructure's performance.\n\nThe scan of your cloud account infrastructure will start immediately after onboarding and the results, meaning the identified issues and security risks will be displayed, usually ranked by severity or risk score.\n\n## Take advantage of the extra visibility\n\nA CSPM will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure, making it easy to prioritize the order and urgency of solving these issues.\n\nYour cloud infrastructure is not a one-way road, cloud assets are interconnected, and it is critical to understand how this can lead to exposed resources.\n\nThe complete cloud assets inventory will automatically be compared against a set of best practices.\n\nHaving full visibility is key when implementing security best practices.\n\nManaging your cloud assets from a single dashboard is an important and useful feature.\n\nYour Security team is responsible for monitoring the cloud against threats, possible attacks, or malicious behavior. Your DevOps team is rapidly building and deploying applications in the cloud (and therefore adding new cloud assets), while your Compliance and Auditing team needs to make sure the company and its cloud infrastructure stay compliant with regulations and standards. What a dedicated solution such as a CSPM does for you, is to make sure that the relevant information is available to each of these teams in an easily comprehensible manner.\n\n## Better security for your cloud environments with the CSPM solution\n\nSome cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform have security recommendations in place, however, you need to understand that they apply only to that specific cloud provider and in many cases, they turn out to be false positives, since the context is not taken into consideration.\n\nNot to mention that a multi-cloud strategy will complicate security efforts since IT security teams must deal with the fact that configuration is different from one cloud provider to the other.\n\nCSPM solutions do not require the deployment of any additional resources to enforce cloud security best practices and will identify and help mitigate these security risks across cloud providers.\n\nAccording to Gartner, CSPM tools can identify risks in the configurations of your [cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) and will immediately react either with automatic remediations or with specific instructions on how to fix the misconfiguration and eliminate risks.\n\nThere are other types of tools that handle sensitive workloads and data in the cloud or that monitor user activity. All these tools are enforcing security policies and together they can ensure the proper protection in the cloud.\n\nSolutions such as Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) can have similar features with a CSPM.\n\nCASB software, for example, was created to monitor and enforce enterprise security, and it is not necessarily cloud-based. It can be installed on-premise, placed between cloud applications and their users acting as a central gateway that controls users' access to the cloud. It includes DLP (Data Loss Prevention) capabilities, Governance, Data encryption, MDM (Mobile Device Management).\n\nCWPP comprises agent-based solutions that offer visibility and security management for workloads. So, the provided inventory mainly covers VMs (Virtual Machines), public cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service), and container-based application architectures. A CWPP solution does not provide event monitoring outside workloads.\n\nEven if CASB, CWPP, and CSPM may sound similar at first, their scope and coverage are different, as they represent different categories. You will need to decide which tool or tools are the right ones for your organization.\n\n## Compliance controls across your environment in the cloud\n\nCompanies that closely follow regulatory compliance are using Cloud Security Posture Management tools to avoid breaches that usually ruin the brand reputation and bring monetary fines to the company.\n\nA CSPM solution can offer predefined Policies needed for compliance with the most common benchmarks and regulations such as CIS, NIST, HIPPA, ISO27001, or others.\n\nConsidering the compliance aspect, you could be tempted to believe that a CSPM solution is just another GRC tool (Governance Risk and Compliance), but in reality, it is more than that.\n\nUsing CSPM software, you can get a grip on your cloud compliance strategy in just a couple of steps:\n\n**Start by identifying the applicable standards for your company.**\n\nUsually, you will find a specific section in the platform where the most common standards and regulations are defined and implemented from a cloud security perspective. PCI-DSS, NIST, GDPR, CIS, ISO, HIPPA - are just some examples of what you can expect to find.\n\n**Next, you will determine the requirements and start documenting your compliance processes.**\n\nPredefined compliance policies are offered, but you will be able to define custom ones, specific to your needs. Policies have technical controls attached that are automatically assessed. In case of a failed assessment, remediation actions are suggested.\n\nA CSPM solution can be a powerful reporting and evidence collection tool, making it easy to always be prepared for audits and inspections.\n\nWhen it comes to defining Policies and Procedures for the governance of your organization — for example, Access Management Policy, Change Management Policy, and so on — Cyscale's solution offers these out-of-the-box and you can use them as baselines, customizable to your needs.\n\n**The last but very important step is to monitor changes and configuration drifts.**\n\nThis is when the ongoing monitoring capability of the CSPM software comes in handy. Once you define your set of policies, the solution will help identify compliance drifts.\n\nYour Compliance Officers can use the CSPM as an in-house audit tool, assisting them in preparing for externally conducted or formal compliance audits.\n\nA CSPM tool will help you handle compliance concerns, minimize threats, catch errors and empower you to align [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) across the company.\n\nWhen you are looking for a CSPM solution, keep in mind that visibility and context go hand in hand and that Cyscale Cloud Platform can offer the most comprehensive context thanks to its unique Security Knowledge Graph™.\n\nAs Gartner stated: “the use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. So, although, there are cases when a CSPM solution's functionalities can overlap with those of other security tools, it could never be fully replaced by any of them.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n*Photo by [Hal Gatewood](https://unsplash.com/@halacious?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":27,"numPages":4,"currentPage":4,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","IAM","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
