Something had to be done, and fast!\n\nThe Cybersecurity market responded with innovation, and so a new security category was born: the _Cloud Infrastructure Security Posture Assessment._\n\nThe main objective of tools in this category was to report configuration errors discovered in the rapidly changing environment that is the cloud.\n\nAs the products quickly evolved and gained in complexity, the initial name was changed to **_CSPM_** - or **_Cloud Security Posture Management_**, but the main purpose of the solutions remained the same: to monitor the cloud infrastructure, [identify potential misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and help with security policy enforcement.\n\nIncluded in Gartner's “Top 10 Security Projects for 2019”, the CSPM represents one of the most important technologies that leaders should invest in when using cloud or multi-cloud infrastructures.\n\n<el name=\"when-cspm\">\n\n### **When to choose a CSPM and when not to**\n\n</el>\n\nA Cloud Security Posture Management solution is a critical part of a Cloud Security Program because it covers the **unintentional risks** that can expose your data.\n\nThese unintentional configuration mistakes are likely to occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility. Regardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches and possibly data leakage.\n\n<el name=\"missconfigurations\">\n\n#### **_Misconfigurations - cause and effect_**\n\n</el>\n\nWe've all heard about major breaches that happened because of AWS S3 buckets being publicly accessible. (This exact [misconfiguration happened to Romania's largest real estate portal](https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach/ 'https://cyscale.com/blog/realestate-data-breach') ).\n\nMany cloud application creators or maintainers don't believe this can happen to them, but, for example, when new virtual machines are launched in a hurry by a less experienced DevOps engineer, mistakes can occur and networks that should have been private are now public and exposed.\n\nOther common misconfigurations that attackers are often exploiting are overprivileged credentials. Restricting users' access to data and resources to only what is strictly required for them to do their jobs is a must, in other words, you need to use the **least privilege principle**.\n\nThe [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) will report and advise against using overly permissive account settings for your users, and at the same time remind you to use encryption, thus strengthening your security and making it even harder for an unauthorized or malicious individual to access and expose your data.\n\nThe advanced CSPM solutions we see these days offer continuous monitoring, risk assessments, remediation recommendations based on security best practices, and assistance for compliance with the most common security frameworks and standards.\n\nWhat if you could have a powerful solution that offers full visibility over your cloud accounts, enabling better communication and collaboration between your Security team, the DevOps, and the Compliance team?\n\nThis solution exists! You need to implement a CSPM to improve your cloud security posture and to build a strong Security Program.\n\nUnlike other security software which takes a lot of time to set up, requiring multiple steps to achieve proper installation and configuration, a CSPM platform is agentless. To have it up and running takes only minutes and best of all, it has no negative impact in your infrastructure's performance.\n\nThe scan of your cloud account infrastructure will start immediately after onboarding and the results, meaning the identified issues and security risks will be displayed, usually ranked by severity or risk score.\n\n<el name=\"extra-visibility\">\n\n### **_Take advantage of the extra visibility_**\n\n</el>\n\nA CSPM will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure, making it easy to prioritize the order and urgency of solving these issues.\n\nYour cloud infrastructure is not a one-way road, cloud assets are interconnected, and it is critical to understand how this can lead to exposed resources.\n\nThe complete cloud assets inventory will automatically be compared against a set of best practices.\n\nHaving full visibility is key when implementing security best practices.\n\nManaging your cloud assets from a single dashboard is an important and useful feature.\n\nYour Security team is responsible for monitoring the cloud against threats, possible attacks, or malicious behavior. Your DevOps team is rapidly building and deploying applications in the cloud (and therefore adding new cloud assets), while your Compliance and Auditing team needs to make sure the company and its cloud infrastructure stay compliant with regulations and standards. What a dedicated solution such as a CSPM does for you, is to make sure that the relevant information is available to each of these teams in an easily comprehensible manner.\n\n<el name=\"better-security\">\n\n### **_Better security for your cloud environments with the CSPM_** **_solution_**\n\n</el>\n\nSome cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform have security recommendations in place, however, you need to understand that they apply only to that specific cloud provider and in many cases, they turn out to be false positives, since the context is not taken into consideration.\n\nNot to mention that a multi-cloud strategy will complicate security efforts since IT security teams must deal with the fact that configuration is different from one cloud provider to the other.\n\nCSPM solutions do not require the deployment of any additional resources to enforce cloud security best practices and will identify and help mitigate these security risks across cloud providers.\n\nAccording to Gartner, CSPM tools can identify risks in the configurations of your cloud infrastructure and will immediately react either with automatic remediations or with specific instructions on how to fix the misconfiguration and eliminate risks.\n\nThere are other types of tools that handle sensitive workloads and data in the cloud or that monitor user activity. All these tools are enforcing security policies and together they can ensure the proper protection in the cloud.\n\nSolutions such as Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) can have similar features with a CSPM.\n\nCASB software, for example, was created to monitor and enforce enterprise security, and it is not necessarily cloud-based. It can be installed on-premise, placed between cloud applications and their users acting as a central gateway that controls users' access to the cloud. It includes DLP (Data Loss Prevention) capabilities, Governance, Data encryption, MDM (Mobile Device Management).\n\nCWPP comprises agent-based solutions that offer visibility and security management for workloads. So, the provided inventory mainly covers VMs (Virtual Machines), public cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service), and container-based application architectures. A CWPP solution does not provide event monitoring outside workloads.\n\nEven if CASB, CWPP, and CSPM may sound similar at first, their scope and coverage are different, as they represent different categories. You will need to decide which tool or tools are the right ones for your organization.\n\n<el name=\"compliance\">\n\n### **_Compliance controls across your environment in the cloud_**\n\n</el>\n\nCompanies that closely follow regulatory compliance are using Cloud Security Posture Management tools to avoid breaches that usually ruin the brand reputation and bring monetary fines to the company.\n\nA CSPM solution can offer predefined Policies needed for compliance with the most common benchmarks and regulations such as CIS, NIST, HIPPA, ISO27001, or others.\n\nConsidering the compliance aspect, you could be tempted to believe that a CSPM solution is just another GRC tool (Governance Risk and Compliance), but in reality, it is more than that.\n\nUsing CSPM software, you can get a grip on your cloud compliance strategy in just a couple of steps:\n\n#### **Start by identifying the applicable standards for your company.**\n\nUsually, you will find a specific section in the platform where the most common standards and regulations are defined and implemented from a cloud security perspective. PCI-DSS, NIST, GDPR, CIS, ISO, HIPPA - are just some examples of what you can expect to find.\n\n#### **Next, you will determine the requirements and start documenting your compliance processes.**\n\nPredefined compliance policies are offered, but you will be able to define custom ones, specific to your needs. Policies have technical controls attached that are automatically assessed. In case of a failed assessment, remediation actions are suggested.\n\nA CSPM solution can be a powerful reporting and evidence collection tool, making it easy to always be prepared for audits and inspections.\n\nWhen it comes to defining Policies and Procedures for the governance of your organization — for example, Access Management Policy, Change Management Policy, and so on — Cyscale's solution offers these out-of-the-box and you can use them as baselines, customizable to your needs.\n\n#### **The last but very important step is to monitor changes and configuration drifts.**\n\nThis is when the ongoing monitoring capability of the CSPM software comes in handy. Once you define your set of policies, the solution will help identify compliance drifts.\n\nYour Compliance Officers can use the CSPM as an in-house audit tool, assisting them in preparing for externally conducted or formal compliance audits.\n\nA CSPM tool will help you handle compliance concerns, minimize threats, catch errors and empower you to align IT security strategy across the company.\n\nWhen you are looking for a CSPM solution, keep in mind that visibility and context go hand in hand and that Cyscale Cloud Platform can offer the most comprehensive context thanks to its unique Security Knowledge Graph™.\n\nAs Gartner stated: “the use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. So, although, there are cases when a CSPM solution's functionalities can overlap with those of other security tools, it could never be fully replaced by any of them.\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n_Photo by [Hal Gatewood](https://unsplash.com/@halacious?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)_\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"What is a CSPM and why should you consider using one?","seoTitle":null,"description":"A CSPM or Cloud Security Posture Management is a tool designed to identify misconfiguration and compliance risks in the cloud while making sure there are no gaps in security policy enforcement.","seoDescription":null,"date":"2021-08-17T12:26:54.609Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cspm-visibility-compliance-security","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/4a356/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/d0c60/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg 205w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/d498f/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg 410w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/4a356/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg 820w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/f3104/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.jpg 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/19b88/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.webp 205w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/cb077/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.webp 410w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/1946f/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.webp 820w,\n/static/4f5b401256870e5fe6c14392bdd82e4f/b6a4d/christina-wocintechchat-com-glrqywjguey-unsplash.webp 1640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":547}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nSome [CSPM tools](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) may be limited to only one cloud provider, others can be used to [detect misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) in a multi-cloud environment, but they all share a purpose: to examine your cloud infrastructure and compare it against a set of best practices, policies and known security risks, in order to help you improve your compliance with certain regulations, as well as your cloud security posture.\n\nBy now we should all be aware of the Shared Responsibility Model practiced by the cloud providers. According to these rules, the customer is entirely responsible for his security configuration. The cloud provider's responsibility is the data center's security only.\n\nOnce you understand that the security offered by cloud providers is insufficient against cloud threats, you might want to look for more efficient tools to secure your cloud assets.\n\nSo why should you consider using this type of tool?\n\nHere are just some of the [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/) capabilities that might make you want to start using one for your cloud infrastructure:\n\n## Misconfiguration detection and prevention\n\nMisconfigurations are most often caused due to a lack of visibility and mismanagement of interconnected resources.\n\nCloud infrastructures are complex, and they differ from one provider to the other, meaning that misconfigurations can easily happen, and the making of the organization can be vulnerable to attacks and open to the possibility of data breaches.\n\nLet's consider the CSPM your configuration drift prevention tool.\n\nIn many situations, a CSPM solution offers cross-cloud visibility, while potentially dangerous events are highlighted for you to see faster. (Events such as users' accounts being granted excessive permissions, having accidentally granted public access to storage buckets or containers, and other similar mistakes)\n\n## Compliance monitoring\n\nCloud resources being created and destroyed often, having data frequently duplicated across regions - these represent common events in a cloud infrastructure, but when it comes to managing compliance, they become challenges that were not encountered before, in an on-premises configuration.\n\nThe CSPM tools offer predefined frameworks for the most popular benchmarks and compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, NIST 800, PCI DSS, SOC 2, CCPA which may help you meet these challenges.\n\nOnce you have set up the policies you consider relevant, the CSPM will give you instant notifications for compliance drifts.\n\nBuilt-in remediation advice or actions are provided in some cases, making it easier for your team to have the dynamic approach needed to follow cloud compliance requirements.\n\n## Security investigation & Incident response\n\nTo effectively apply security best practices, you need to be able to visualize what assets exist, what is the current protection in place, and what are high-risk alerts that you need to attend to first.\n\nFast response in case of a security incident is crucial.\n\nHaving automated monitoring, misconfiguration detection and real-time analysis in your cloud security configuration is an important aspect when it comes to keeping your organization audit ready.\n\nCSPM solutions enable organizations to automate cloud security processes and evidence collection and help mitigate attacks.\n\n## Risk visualization & assessment\n\nThe CSPM will continuously monitor the cloud environments in real-time for threat detection.\n\nIt will automatically assess your security posture immediately after onboarding, and you will have the possibility to create policies that meet your needs.\n\nA quantifying risk will be presented for all detected security violations, so that you can prioritize solving the issues brought to your attention.\n\nThere are different approaches depending on the vendor, but one thing is clear: “The use of a CSPM tool can reduce cloud-based security incidents due to misconfigurations by 80%”. (According to Gartner)\n\nYou just need to find the CSPM solution that suits your security and compliance needs and gives you the best possible visibility over your cloud assets.\n\nCyscale for example, has an innovative approach to CSPM, allowing you to map, secure, and monitor your cloud assets across platforms in less than 5 minutes after onboarding.\n\nThe solution is called Cyscale Cloud Platform, and it will most definitely help you understand how assets are interconnected.\n\nUnlike other CSPM solutions that provide you with endless lists of logs, Cyscale Cloud Platform makes it easy for you to understand context by placing your cloud assets in a unique Security Knowledge Graph™ view.\n\nIt will surface crucial issues of all your interlinked cloud assets, helping you improve your security and data governance procedures.\n\nComplete visibility over your infrastructure and deep contextual understanding of your cloud assets inventory is possible only by using the unique power of Cyscale Cloud Platform, so start your free trial today!\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\n_Photo by [christina@wocintechchat.com](https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)_\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":27,"numPages":4,"currentPage":4,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["News","Compliance","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
