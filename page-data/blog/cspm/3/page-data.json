If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n\n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for GCP. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","seoTitle":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","description":"Data classification is a way of grouping data to ensure easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.

Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in GCP, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow GCP customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your GCP environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies","seoTitle":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies - Cyscale","description":"A CSPM product is a component of cloud security that uses controls to identify misconfigurations, sends targeted alerts to companies, provides step on how to remediate findings and helps you achieve compliance with international standards. 5 best practices and strategies are: ensure visibility of assets, classify assets and prioritize the most important ones, achieve compliance with international standards, monitor your infrastructure and ensure logging, remediate findings quickly.

Ensure visibility of assets\n\nIf you have a large number of assets, it is challenging to guarantee discovery and visibility and to find security design issues. \n\nBroad visibility and discovery of assets may help you identify: \n\n* misconfigurations that may cause vulnerabilities in your system, \n* poor access control, \n* weak data security, and others. \n\nBelow, you can see a section of Cyscale’s powerful dashboard, where you can also find the status of your controls, alerts, and others. \n\nThis inventory helps you keep track of assets and be aware of the different components in your cloud environment. \n\n![Dashboard inventory in Cyscale](/img/inventory-dashboard.png#shadow \"Dashboard inventory in Cyscale\")\n\n#### 2. Classify assets and prioritize the most important ones\n\nAsset classification is very important; it will help you prioritize the assets with high risk and high importance. \n\nA company's security can be considerably improved by categorizing assets according to their risk and by setting remediation priorities. \n\n#### 3. Achieve compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and others.\n\nA CSPM can help you achieve compliance by: \n\nensuring your cloud environment is implementing requirements and best practices,  \n\nproviding evidence of your organization’s efforts and speeding up the auditing process. \n\nThere is a long list of international standards that regulate configurations of cloud environments: \n\n* ISO 27001,  \n* GDPR,  \n* HIPAA, \n* PCI-DSS, \n* NIST, and many more. \n\n![International compliance standards](/img/standards.png#shadow \"International compliance standards\")\n\n#### 4. Monitor your infrastructure\n\nIdentifying threats early is crucial to preventing incidents. Keep logs and document every action and event to be able to respond to threats as they appear. \n\nMonitoring and logging your infrastructure can help you: \n\n* notice odd behavior, \n* identify misconfigurations, \n* provide accountability for employees’ and customers’ actions. \n\n#### 5. Remediate findings quickly\n\nSolving misconfigurations and responding to incidents promptly is essential – it can prevent a threat from becoming a breach.  \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are:  \n\n* implementing strong encryption for sensitive data, \n* eliminating administrator or root accounts that are not necessary, \n* using access lists and policies to restrict unwanted traffic. \n\nA CSPM can help you remediate failed controls and quickly patch your systems. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that can help you implement the best practices described in this article and even more. You can use over 400 controls and powerful dashboards to: \n\n* obtain visibility and discovery of your cloud environment, \n* manage high priority assets, \n* identify misconfigurations in a timely manner, \n* ensure compliance with international standards, \n* solve findings and ensure security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Securing Your Technology Stack ","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security: A Comprehensive Guide to Securing Your Technology Stack ","description":"An article about cloud native security.

It is built outside the cloud and later transferred into one, in order to enjoy some of its benefits. \n\n<div id=\"advantages\">\n\n## Advantages of going cloud-native\n\n</div>\n\nTo better understand the differences between cloud-native and on-premises apps that do not use cloud, we will look at the former’s advantages and disadvantages over the latter’s.\n\n### Speed \n\nNative applications are easier and faster to build and deploy than on-premises ones because no sophisticated software or hardware requirements need to be fulfilled. Moreover, updates are also implemented faster in a cloud-native architecture and require no downtime.\n\n### Cost \n\nThe cost of using cloud-native technology depends on the application but is generally lower since it does not require the purchase of expensive hardware. For example, instead of buying a computer, you use virtual machines.\n\nTypically, cloud-native applications only require software licenses or subscriptions. \n\n### Scalability \n\nSince cloud-native environments do not require hardware upgrades, they are scalable and adaptable to business requirements. \n\nAccording to [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation), an open source project, “cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications”. \n\n### Resiliency \n\nThe cloud is known for its resiliency against natural disasters, power outages and other incidents that may disrupt a cloud-enabled application. Native cloud workloads are therefore more resilient. \n\n### A serverless model \n\nCloud-native applications may work on a serverless model by leaving the provisioning and maintaining tasks to the cloud provider. This model simplifies the deployment steps and eases the developer's work, increasing productivity. \n\nMoreover, using this model, cloud-native applications can be launched only when needed, the code in serverless functions responding to triggers and consuming resources when necessary. An advantage is that costs are reduced for applications. \n\n<div id=\"guide-to-secure-cloud\">\n\n## How to secure your cloud-native application\n\n</div>\n\nAccording to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/), cloud-native security can be approached in 4 layers, called the 4 C’s: \n\n1. Code, \n2. Container, \n3. Cluster, \n4. Cloud. \n\n### Code \n\nThe inner layer of security refers to the code; it is the part the application’s developer has the most control over, yet it can be one of a hacker's most appealing attack surfaces. \n\nApplication code security is usually an underrated cybersecurity mechanism and neglecting it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Here are a few security practices for securing code: \n\n* **Sanitize input.** This can go a long way and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others. \n* **Use encryption.** Data at rest and data in transit should always be encrypted. Make sure you’re sending application data encrypted through TLS. \n* **Ensure modern cryptography.** Even if you’re using encryption and hashing, make sure that: \n\n  * You’re not using deprecated algorithms, such as DES for encryption and MD5 for hashing, Instead, use AES and SHA-256 or newer, which are the current standards. \n  * You’re storing cryptographic keys safely (and not in the source code). \n  * You’re rotating keys regularly to safeguard against brute-force attacks on them. \n* **Only open the ports you’re using.** Don’t forget open ports, especially on internet-facing applications. This is one of the ways attackers can gain access to the cloud infrastructure and infect it with malware. \n\n### Container \n\nThe next layer of security for native cloud is controlled at the container level. \n\nContainers are virtualization tools which allow you to run applications in isolated environments, separated from the hardware.  \n\nIf your application uses various technologies, you can install any needed packages and resolve dependencies in the container instead of on the host operating system. \n\nAnother useful feature of containers is that you can create container image templates and replicate environments without having to re-install tools and technologies. \n\nThe most known containerization services are Docker and Kubernetes.  \n\nDocker is a platform that enables developers to deploy applications in a containerized environment. Docker runs over a single node (machine), while Kubernetes is a container orchestration service. \n\nDocker and Kubernetes are usually seen as competitors, but they work very well together; Kubernetes can help manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. \n\nHowever, there are a few security issues that need to be addressed regarding containers security: \n\n* **Do not run containers as root.** Developers find it easier to run containers as root because they don't have to provide their password when executing an action that requires root privileges. However, this opens up a wide palette of vulnerabilities; any attacker that would gain access to the container would have root privileges and, therefore, the highest level of permissions. \n* **Reduce the attack surface.** If an attacker gains access to the container, make sure they cannot escalate their privileges or escape the container; eliminate the use of UNIX binaries that can be used to bypass rules, such as \"sed\" and \"awk\". \n* **Implement a strong network policy**—for example, filter traffic to and from the container and use firewalls to ensure robust security. \n\n### Cluster \n\nThe third layer for cloud-native security is managed in clusters. \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It comprises the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining for example which application is running in which container. \n\nThe nodes that are part of a cluster run the applications. \n\nLet’s understand how to protect clusters with the following security solutions:\n\n* **Implement Authentication.** This step requires the user to prove they are who they claim to be. The authentication process may be different from service to service, but it can require credentials like passwords, client certificates, tokens, and others. \n* **Implement Authorization.** Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes authorization by assigning roles to users and managing their privileges at role level to ensure application security. \n* **Control what privileges containers run with.** Establish permissions by using security contexts. These are settings that can be applied to a container or a set of containers inside a cluster that define privileges and access control. \n\n### Cloud \n\nThe outer layer of a cloud-native application refers to cloud infrastructure and configuration. Let’s see how to fix [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and secure your cloud-native application against attackers. \n\n* **Restrict inbound and outbound traffic.** Make sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to blacklist ranges of IPs and ports.  \n* **Ensure compliance with the Least Privilege Principle.** Make sure no user has more privileges than required to carry out their tasks and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n* **Implement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.** Ensure that no one can read databases, files, and other resources if they gain access to your company's cloud. \n\nYou can identify misconfigurations in the cloud and remediate them effectively using the Cyscale security platform.\n\nThe Cyscale Cloud Platform offers a [CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/) security tool that: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities using security controls, \n* provides integration with the most important public cloud service providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP (Google Cloud), Azure, Alibaba, and supports multi-cloud environments,\n* sends relevant alerts,  \n* provides remediation steps to help your security teams protect your cloud environment effectively and overcome security challenges, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Product"],"title":"Creating a Security Knowledge Graph™ Through Integrations","seoTitle":"Creating a Security Knowledge Graph™ Through Integrations","description":"A knowledge graph is the perfect tool to analyze your cloud environment and observe employees' workflows and possible vulnerabilities.

So, let's see how you can do it.\n\n## What is the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is a data model based on deep understanding that maps cloud assets and their relationships, as well as information from adjacent data sources to provide context-aware security and deliver a comprehensive security analysis over an organization. \n\n**Google uses a Knowledge Graph** to power the results of its search engine by keeping a database of billions of records. \n\nThat is how [Google](https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176?hl=en) is able to answer questions accurately with context. \n\nThe Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™ is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between all of your cloud assets, as well as other apps and systems that may affect cloud security posture, and automatically pinpoints security issues.  \n\nThe graph is more than just a way to visualize assets and systems; it uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities. \n\n## Why use a Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nYou could go through sets of configuration best practices and verify them against each cloud resource.  \n\nHowever, when looked at in isolation, a resource may be misconfigured, but the relations it has with other assets, as well as its position in the network (for example, if it’s in a private network or if it is Internet-facing) may greatly influence the criticality of the situation. \n\nThe Security Knowledge Graph™ is built on top of a graph database that contains nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns to create comprehensive graphs. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a Security Knowledge Graph™.  \n\nNotice how a very complex system with intricate relationships and hidden vulnerabilities is so much easier to understand and observe when looking at it in a graph. \n\n![The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](/img/2-general.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n## Are you unsure if you need the Security Knowledge Graph™? \n\nLet me show you why you do!  \n\nRead the following scenarios to see if you can find your company in any of the situations described.  \n\n### Scenario 1: HR and identity providers \n\nAn employee joins the company and is onboarded using an HR management tool, such as BambooHR or Workday. \n\nAn account is created for the employee using an identity provider such as [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/), through which they receive access to a production [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) account, GitHub, and many other sensitive applications that may end up having an effect on the company's cloud infrastructure. \n\nWhen the employee leaves the company, they are offboarded from the HR portal, and the human resources department thinks the employee's accounts were completely deprovisioned.  \n\nHowever, since the Okta administrator did not correctly deprovision his account, the former employee **still has access to production code**. \n\n![HR and identity providers scenario in a graph](/img/3-scenariu-1.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 2: Misconfigured permissions \n\nIt is not uncommon to have employees with very similar names within the same company. For example, assume user John Smith, a software developer, and Jonathan Smith, an accountant, are both employees at the same company. \n\nThey are mistaken for one another and instead of John, the software developer, it is Jonathan who receives the credentials instead, thus gaining access to a sensitive account.  \n\nWhile trying to understand the reasoning behind this, Jonathan explores the account and accidentally **deletes a resource from the cloud**. \n\n![Misconfigured permissions in graph](/img/4-scenariu-2.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\n### Scenario 3: False positives in vulnerability scans \n\nA company uses Tenable or CrowdStrike, endpoint vulnerability scanners.  \n\nA virtual machine running an application with Log4J has the Log4Shell vulnerability. As a result, critical alerts are generated, and the software engineers will prioritize this issue over other current vulnerabilities. \n\nHowever, Log4J is only running in a private network, not accessible from the Internet. The issue still needs to be addressed, but the severity is high instead of critical. \n\n**Instead of securing Internet-facing applications and devices, engineers are distracted by less essential tasks** due to contextless alerts. \n\n![False positives in vulnerability scans](/img/5-scenariu-3.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nKeep in mind that these are some examples. There are plenty of other situations where contextual awareness is the best way to notice existing vulnerabilities before they become breaches. \n\n  \n\n[Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) is leading a continuous effort to integrate as many services and tools as possible and expand the Knowledge Graph to cover a great range of security scenarios. \n\nWe currently integrate with: \n\n* AWS (Amazon Web Services), \n* GCP (Google Cloud Platform), \n* Microsoft Azure, \n* Alibaba Cloud, \n* Okta, and others. \n\nThere are many more integrations to come soon: AWS SSO, GitHub, Azure AD, Kubernetes, GSuite. \n\n![Integrations in Cyscale](/img/6-tabel.png#shadow \"Integrations in Cyscale\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Product"],"title":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","seoTitle":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. Controls in Cyscale check your Okta configurations for the following: if there are at least two Okta admins configured, if application assignments are configured through groups, if MFA is configured and it has strong factors, if there are no weak password policies.","seoDescription":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. It is important to integrate an identity provider with a CSPM to monitor security posture in one single place and see all of your IAM users in context.

Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.png#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.png#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","seoTitle":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","description":"A CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool is a product that scans your cloud environment for vulnerabilities and alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure.

It alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure. \n\nThis article will discuss what you need to look for in a CSPM and help you make the right choice regarding your [cloud's security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n### Does it check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities? \n\nThere is a long list of possible misconfigurations, policy violations, and mistakes that can disrupt your cloud system. \n\nA good CSPM tool will have controls to check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities and correctly identify any misconfigurations. \n\nSome of [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) are: \n\n* Poor storage access configuration, \n* Broken access control, \n* Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, \n* Missing encryption, \n* Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\n### Does it have an integration with your preferred cloud platform? \n\nThe CSPM tool you choose must be compatible with the cloud platform your system is using. The top three vendors in the cloud industry are: \n\n* [Amazon Web Services Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) \n* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) \n* [Microsoft Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) \n\nWith Cyscale, you can scan and maintain your cloud security posture for all three of the vendors mentioned above, as well as Alibaba Cloud. \n\nAnother essential feature is that Cyscale integrates Okta identities. \n\n### What compliance frameworks does it support? \n\nA certificate of [compliance with a standard such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) can be an asset because it advertises the following things about your company: \n\n* You understand the significance of cybersecurity, \n* Your organization is working to reduce the risk of information security breaches, \n* You are adequately managing information security. \n\nIn order to make the best use of your CSPM, take into account what compliance standard or certification your company is going for. A few examples are: \n\n* ISO 27001 \n* SOC 2 \n* NIST 800-53 \n* PCI-DSS \n* CIS \n* GDPR \n\nSome standards require you to write your own policies such as Data Protection or Disaster Recovery.  \n\nYou can manage them using traditional tools such as Microsoft Word and Sharepoint, or you can use a powerful policy editor and gain inline evidence collection offered by Cyscale. \n\n### Is the CSPM providing vulnerability and risk scoring? \n\nPrioritization of issues and risk scoring is an essential feature of a CSPM. \n\nAssigning risk levels to assets and prioritizing remediation can significantly increase a company's security. \n\nVulnerability scoring is another essential feature that can help you avoid false positives and prioritize tasks. Time is crucial when discussing vulnerabilities, so quick actions need to be taken to prevent breaches. \n\nThis is why it is essential to ensure that false positives are avoided because they can cause noise that may distract employees from more important matters. \n\n![Alerts divided by severity](/img/alerts-severity.jpeg#shadow \"Risk scoring in Cyscale\")\n\n### Do you receive targeted alerts? \n\nReceiving thousands of alerts can be overwhelming. Your CSPM tool needs to filter them and send relevant, targeted alerts. \n\nCyscale currently has two types of notifications that can be customized to your preference: \n\n1. Security Posture. These weekly digests show you your cloud security posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count. You can see an example below. \n\n![A Security Posture email showing a posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count](/img/security-posture.png#shadow \"Security Posture Email from Cyscale\")\n\n2. Alerts. They are sent in batches for a given cloud account in a single email to ensure that they do not become overwhelming. These alerts inform you of new vulnerabilities found in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nBesides these personal notifications sent to your email, you can also enable alerts on Slack, Teams, or an app of your choice, by using Webhook. \n\n### Does it provide remediation for found vulnerabilities? \n\nFinding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure is just the first step. \n\nApplying the correct remediation before it becomes a breach is critical to securing your cloud.  \n\nCyscale provides, along with the controls that pinpoint what vulnerability has been identified, the following: \n\n* an explanation of the cause of the control failure, \n* how the vulnerability was identified, \n* remediation steps. \n\nThe remediation steps can ensure you're applying the modifications correctly and speed up the process of securing your assets. \n\nMake the right decision for your company by using a robust [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/) that helps secure your cloud infrastructure and provides all of the features mentioned above and more. \n\nCyscale ensures the following features: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities, \n* integration with AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, Okta, \n* support for compliance frameworks and standards, \n* prioritization of assets remediation and alerts, \n* targeted and custom alerts, \n* remediation steps and vulnerabilities reports. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Okta Security Best Practices ","seoTitle":"Okta Security Best Practices ","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud.

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee uses a weak password for their accounts. The password was cracked through a brute-force attack by an attacker. \n\nThe employee re-uses their password for Okta SSO, and MFA is not implemented in the company, so the attacker now has full access to all of the employee's accounts. \n\n### Best practice \n\n[MFA](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is a type of authentication that requires an entity to provide at least two different types of credentials. \n\nThey should be of the following:  \n\n* What you know (example: a PIN)  \n* What you have (example: a security token)  \n* What you are (example: a fingerprint)  \n\nOkta recommends you use a one-time password or a biometric verification in your authentication scheme in order to add an extra layer of security. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 2. Stop using passwords \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee writes their password on a post-it note and leaves it on their desk. \n\nAn employee from another department finds it and can now login into the employee's account. \n\n### Best practice \n\nPasswordless authentication is possible by providing a public identifier (such as a username or an email address) and then using a different way of proving your identity (through a phone or a token, for example), thus eliminating the use of passwords. \n\nThis type of authentication is secure because: \n\n* Weak passwords are no longer a concern for your company \n* Solutions for password storage are not an issue anymore \n* The credentials cannot be breached; therefore, you're reducing the number of points of failure \n\nOkta suggests solutions that can help you go passwordless. You can use: \n\n* Okta Fastpass, which allows you to authenticate passwordless from any device or location to any Okta-managed application; \n* WebAuthn, a standard that simplifies authentication. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 3. Manage user access by following the Least Privilege Principle \n\n### Scenario \n\nAlthough they do not require such privileges, an employee was assigned administrative rights. \n\nThe employee accidentally deletes an asset—this action results in permanent data loss. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that users should not have more permissions than they require to perform their tasks. \n\nUser access control management is a security best practice recommended by [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) that helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nFor example, a regular user should not have administrator rights unless they need them for daily tasks. \n\nMake sure to restrict users as much as possible in accordance with their jobs. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 4. Ensure the Separation of Duties \n\n### Scenario \n\nThe administrator goes on vacation. They are the only ones with administrator privileges.  \n\nA critical vulnerability appears in the cloud infrastructure, but nobody has the necessary rights to patch it. The administrator cannot be contacted and is out of the office for a few weeks. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Separation of Duties Principle helps eliminate a single point of failure by assuring no entity has the rights to execute a critical task by themselves. \n\nConfiguring at least two administrators eliminates the single point of failure. It ensures that if one of them is missing, the other can still perform tasks requiring administrative privileges. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 5. Monitor activity \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn attacker manages to gain control of an employee's account and authenticates from a different device or an unusual location. \n\nThis authentication is logged, but the logs are not carefully monitored, so the breach goes undetected. \n\nThe hacker can now move laterally and compromise workstations, databases, and other accounts without raising any alarms in the company. \n\n### Best practice \n\nLogging and monitoring are two features that should be implemented in your cloud environment. \n\nThese technologies can help you identify suspicious behavior, such as: \n\n* **an impossible log-in**, for example when a user authenticates from two different parts of the world in a few minutes, \n* **a user connecting to an application from a different device than expected**, and others. \n\nOkta recommends that you constantly look for odd activity in your cloud infrastructure and make sure you take actions when you identify them, such as verifying a user's identity through MFA. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 6. Automate onboarding and offboarding \n\n### Scenario \n\nA software developer leaves the company, but their account is not correctly deprovisioned.  \n\nThey can still contribute to GitHub repositories and modify production code. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious. \n\nThere should be a well-defined set of steps when an employee leaves the company. Automate as many of them as possible, to make sure that: \n\n* You correctly deprovision their account, and \n* They cannot access and make changes to your systems anymore. \n\n<br/>\n\nAre you following these best practices in your company? \n\nWith [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can detect drifts from some of these best practices recommended by Okta. \n\nCyscale checks if access to your cloud environment is correctly configured and is implementing the following: \n\n* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Logging and monitoring, \n* Access control, \n* Strong credential policies and many more. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":18,"numPages":4,"currentPage":3,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["CSPM","CNAPP","News","Product","Compliance","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
