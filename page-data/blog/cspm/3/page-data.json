A message queue, in the context of the cloud, is a service used to temporarily store data before it is processed.  \n\nA message queue's role is to act like a buffer; if a service is too busy processing data and would otherwise drop traffic, then that traffic is added to a queue for temporary storage. \n\nA message queue usually works based on the FIFO mechanism. FIFO (First In, First Out) allows easy retrieval of messages based on their order of arrival to ensure a smooth process. That means the messages are extracted from the queue in the order they arrive. \n\n## Cloud vendors and queues \n\nLet’s look at solutions offered by cloud vendors and understand how to secure queues used in the cloud infrastructure. \n\n### 1. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) \n\nThis solution helps you manage distributed systems and asynchronous tasks by storing messages in a buffer and waiting until the system is ready to process them. A few of the benefits offered by Amazon through this service are: \n\n* Security, \n* Durability, \n* Availability,  \n* Scalability, and others. \n\n### 2. Azure Queue Storage \n\nAzure Queue Storage helps you store large volumes of messages that can be accessed using authenticated HTTP or HTTPS requests. This type of storage offered by Microsoft Azure is useful in managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring no data loss occurs. \n\n### 3. Cloud Tasks in Google Cloud \n\nCloud Tasks is a slightly different service than we've discussed so far; Google Cloud allows users to store asynchronous tasks in queues and easily manage them.  \n\nThis type of queue can be used as a task scheduling system since you can set a time when a task should be executed. \n\nHowever, even though the queues in Cloud Tasks are designed for tasks, message passing is a use case of the queues.  \n\nAnother solution, very similar to Cloud Tasks, is Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub is a message queueing system that functions on a predefined set of rules, where there is a set of Subscribers, who all receive the queued messages from the Publisher when an event occurs. \n\n## Queues in the Cloud - Best Practices \n\nWhen thinking about [data security in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/), we think of secure storage and assets protection. For this reason, it is very easy to overlook where your sensitive data might end up; and queues are one place. \n\n**Don’t leave queues out of your data security program**; secure every state of data and ensure that you don’t have any vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet’s look at best practices for securing queues in the cloud. \n\n### 1. Encrypt the data that arrives in queues. \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is critical in data security; it ensures that your traffic is confidential. \n\nWhether you implement client-side encryption (which means encrypting the data before sending it) or server-side encryption (where the cloud vendor deals with the encryption process), you need to ensure you don't have information in plain text. \n\nBesides these options, you can also make sure that, after leaving the queue, your data is stored encrypted. For example, AWS S3 assets allow users to set default encryption for data that arrives, so new objects are always stored encrypted.  \n\n### 2. Log actions that affect queues. \n\nKeep details of requests made to the queue; whether they are successful or failed, ensure you keep track of what happens to queues. Important signals that can help you identify any irregularities in your queues' configuration are:  \n\n* Authentication attempts,  \n* Latency, \n* Queue depth (the number of messages waiting to be processed), \n* Request and response sizes, and others. \n\nWhy are these parameters important? For example, if your cloud infrastructure is under a DDoS attack, you can quickly identify that by looking at requests and their size; such attacks usually send either very large volumes of data often or big requests that are meant to slow down your system. \n\n### 3. Restrict access to queue management and ensure access control \n\nImplement [the Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only allow a small group of users to change queue configurations. Following [recommendations offered by Google](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/secure-queue-configuration), deploy specific roles like Queue Administrator and assign them only to users who require those roles. \n\nBesides management, you should also have in place good access control rules. For example, IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies that restrict unnecessary access should be implemented and applied to queues. \n\n### 4. Configure a dead-letter queue \n\nA dead-letter queue (DLQ) is a type of queue designed for messages that, for various reasons, cannot be stored in the queue and processed correctly. Some of the reasons why messages may end up in DLQs are: \n\n* The application in which the queue is used has logical errors, \n* The message length limit was exceeded, \n* The queue is full, and others. \n\nDead-letter queues are useful for debugging what went wrong with the messages’ processing. For example, using a DLQ, you can look at rejected messages and then redirect them to your main queues. \n\n### 5. Use private endpoints for your queues \n\nAlthough most cloud providers enable you to have storage assets (and queues) open to the internet, it is the safest to use private endpoints. \n\nThis can be done using a Private Link, which creates a private connection between the services in the cloud and the queue.  \n\nThis way, traffic does not unnecessarily reach the public internet, and a layer of security is added. \n\n### 6. Configure a good retention period \n\nThe retention period refers to how long messages are stored in the queue before they are deleted. **A longer retention period** is recommended to provide flexibility in your environment and allow some time between the moment a message is received and when it is processed. \n\nFor example, Amazon SQS lets you configure a retention period between 1 minute and 14 days. \n\n## Protect your data using Cyscale \n\nAfter understanding best practices regarding queue security, it’s time to ensure you’re implementing them.  \n\nYou can easily do this using Cyscale!

It is easy to overlook even the smallest configuration and introduce a vulnerability in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nIn this article, you will find a comprehensive guide that will help you understand possible misconfigurations in your AWS cloud infrastructure and how to remediate them.  \n\n## Steps to secure your cloud environment \n\n### 1. Data classification \n\n[Classifying your cloud data](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) can help you easily sort, retrieve, and prioritize it. This is done using a tag (sometimes called a label), which is applied to cloud storage assets. In this way, that data is placed into one or more categories and can be identified more easily. \n\nBenefits of data classification include: \n\n* Risk management, \n* Compliance,  \n* Security. \n\nIn AWS, tags are key-value pairs that add metadata to your data. \n\nThe AWS documentation recommends using a three-tiered approach, with the following tags: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official,  \n* Secret. \n\nHowever, users can tailor data classification to their needs and use their own tags. In addition, **tag policies** can be used to standardize their creation and ensure consistency across all assets. \n\nTo accomplish classification using tags in your AWS environment, you have the following options: \n\n* Using the Amazon console, at resource level, where tags can be added either at creation or after, \n* Programmatically, using the Amazon API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. \n\nAccording to the AWS documentation, restrictions regarding tags include: \n\n* There cannot be more than 50 tags per resource, \n* Each tag key must be unique for each resource, \n* The maximum key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8, \n* The maximum value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. \n\n### 2. Encryption \n\nEncryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality because entities that do not have the decryption key cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, cannot read its content. \n\nThe two types of encryption mechanisms are: \n\n* **Symmetric encryption**, where the encryption and the decryption key are the same, and \n* **Asymmetric encryption**, where the two keys are different; one is called public key and the other private key. \n\nEncryption can be done in all three states of data: \n\n* [At rest,](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) \n* In transit, \n* In use. \n\nIn this article, we will discuss data encryption in the first two states, but [a more detailed article](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) regarding encryption also describes encryption in the last state of data. \n\nFor data in transit, AWS provides the following solution: \n\n1. Encrypt the data using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n2. Perform client-side encryption. This solution requires the user to encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud, but it is more difficult since the client has to deal with the encryption process, key management, and other services. \n\nFor data at rest, AWS provides encryption for the following services:  \n\n* Amazon EBS,  \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift,  \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nAWS uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm, an industry-recommended standard and one of the strongest algorithms for symmetric encryption. \n\nKey management is also a very important element of data encryption. If your keys are not stored safely, then no matter how strong the encryption algorithm is, a malicious party may be able to read your data. \n\nA few best practices regarding encryption keys are: \n\n* Do not store your keys in the same place as your data or in the source code, \n* Rotate and retire keys regularly to minimize the impact of a breach, \n* Manage key deletion, \n* Use Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs) to generate your keys. \n\nAWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) is a comprehensive solution that helps users deal with all the trouble that comes with cryptographic keys. \n\nAWS KMS helps you: \n\n* Create cryptographic keys, \n* Define policies and control how the keys are used, \n* Audit the keys usage to ensure they are used legitimately. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used: \n\n1. Through the AWS Management Console, \n2. Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### 3. Access control \n\nRegulating access control is an essential step to your [cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) program.  \n\nTo manage access control in AWS, you can use policies, which can be assigned at the following levels: \n\n* Users, \n* Groups of users, \n* Roles, \n* Resources. \n\nPolicies define permissions. To correctly implement them, use the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) to only allow access rights to the necessary users for the minimum amount of time possible.  \n\nLet’s look at an example where a policy is applied to a resource.  \n\nAn AWS S3 bucket is a type of asset used to store object-like data such as files, databases, and other unstructured data. \n\nA bucket policy contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied and is written in JSON.  \n\n```jsonld\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"S3PolicyId1\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\",\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"NotIpAddress\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*Policy source – docs.aws.amazon.com* \n\nAnalyzing the image above, we understand that the policy is applied to a bucket resource, the rule for the permission is “Deny”, and the result of the bucket policy is denying access to the objects stored in the specified bucket unless the requests are made with source IPs in the subnet 54.240.143.0/24. \n\n### 4. Data loss prevention \n\nData loss prevention (DLP) is a protection mechanism for sensitive data that ensures that no unintentional or malicious disclosures occur. DLP prevents data breaches by ensuring no confidential data is accidentally leaked, lost, or stolen. \n\n**Amazon Macie** is a data security and privacy service that protects users’ sensitive data using machine learning technologies and pattern matching. \n\nThis tool identifies sensitive data using **sensitive data discovery jobs**, which analyze S3 buckets. Sensitive data discovery jobs use pre-defined or user-defined lists (or a combination of both) to single out confidential data by matching patterns to the lists. \n\nA passport number is an example of sensitive data that Amazon Macie could match. This is because it has a set number of digits, some corresponding to the owner's region or country. \n\nAfter identifying sensitive data, Amazon Macie can: \n\n* use IAM policies to filter traffic to it,  \n* encrypt and decrypt data,  \n* perform logging and monitoring through AWS CloudTrail integration, and others.  \n\n### 5. Availability \n\nAvailability means that users should be able to access their data without disruptions at any point. \n\nA solution for availability in the cloud is **availability zones**. \n\nAn availability zone is a geographical area where groups of data centers are located. These data centers contain replicated data and provide redundancy regarding electrical power, networking, and connectivity. \n\nAn AWS region contains multiple AWS availability zones, all within 100km of each other, which are independent and provide redundancy. \n\nSome AWS regions around the globe are: \n\n* North America,  \n* South America, \n* Europe,  \n* China,  \n* South Africa, and others. \n\nThese regions provide high availability. \n\nAnother solution for availability is DDoS Protection. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are attempts to bring down a service or a resource by sending a large amount of traffic to them using controlled machines. \n\nAWS Shield is the AWS DDoS Protection service that protects applications hosted in the cloud. \n\nAWS Shield has two tiers: \n\n* Standard, \n* Advanced. \n\nBesides the features that come with the Standard plan, which are at network and transport layer, the Advanced tier of AWS Shield provides: \n\n* integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* real-time visibility into attacks,  \n* additional detection and mitigation of sophisticated DDOS attacks, and others. \n\n## Secure your cloud environment \n\nAfter understanding the security demands required for the cloud, implementing them seems like a daunting task. However, using Cyscale, you can easily check if you’re lacking any of the mentioned implementations and remediate any findings. \n\nCyscale has over 400 controls that cover a large variety of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and offer support not only for AWS, but for Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud as well. \n\n\n\nEnhance your AWS cloud data security with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/) to automate the contextual analysis of misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, access, and data for an accurate risk assessment.

Buckets are object storage services and are similar to folders; this type of storage is flexible and scalable and is ideal for large files and unstructured data. \n\n## Common S3 Bucket Misconfigurations \n\n### 1. Public access to a bucket is allowed. \n\nSometimes, Amazon S3 buckets are required to be publicly accessible. For example, this use case occurs when the owner intends to make data accessible to the internet.  \n\nHowever, breaches occur when a bucket that has sensitive information such [as PII (Personal Identifiable Information)](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) allows: \n\n* Public “READ” access, \n* Public “WRITE” access.  \n\nYou can grant and deny access to a bucket using **access lists** and **bucket policies**.  \n\nAn access control list (ACL) is a set of rules that limit access to buckets through permissions. It defines an account's access level over a bucket (for example, READ or WRITE).  \n\nA bucket policy also contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied, but it is a more modern solution because it can enable more complex filtering. It is a JSON-based access policy language. \n\nAmazon recommends that you no longer use ACLs beside special cases, in which you need to filter access to objects individually.  \n\n### 2. No at rest encryption is performed. \n\n[Data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) should always be encrypted to ensure confidentiality and improve your cloud data security.  \n\nPerforming encryption on the objects inside a bucket ensures that, even if a malicious entity gains access to your data, they cannot read it.  \n\nAWS provides multiple encryption options to protect data at rest. For example, you can enable default encryption and set it, so it automatically encrypts any new objects added to the bucket.  \n\nEncryption should be done using industry-recommended algorithms and strong cryptographic keys. A strong encryption algorithm is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 3. In transit encryption is not enabled. \n\nBesides the data that is already stored, you should also encrypt the data that travels to and from the S3 bucket.  \n\nThis step prevents eavesdropping attacks. It is not enough to store your data encrypted. Your efforts are wasted if it travels in plain text and attackers can read it. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nAnother solution for in motion encryption is preparing the data that is to be transported by encrypting it on the client-side. \n\n### 4. Logging is disabled. \n\nLogging an S3 bucket is an essential step in securing your data. With logging, you can record actions taken by users, keep log files for compliance purposes and understand what roles have permission to access data inside a bucket. \n\nThere are two solutions for AWS bucket logging: \n\n* Server access logging, and \n* AWS CloudTrail. \n\nWith server access logging, you obtain detailed records regarding requests that are made to a bucket. \n\nAWS CloudTrail is a comprehensive service that tracks user activity and API calls. It can be used to keep a record of who sends requests to a bucket.  \n\nIt is important to keep in mind that AWS CloudTrail does not log failed authentication attempts through incorrect credentials. However, it does track requests made by anonymous or unauthorized users. \n\n### 5. No regular backups are performed \n\nAttackers may not only try to steal your sensitive data, but they can also delete it. Therefore, ensuring regular and consistent backups is essential to configuring your buckets and providing availability. \n\nUsing AWS Backup, you can perform S3 bucket backups. Amazon supports the following types of backups: \n\n* **Continuous backups**, which allow data restoration from any moment in the last 35 days, \n* **Periodic backups**, which can be performed every 1 hour, 12 hours, or less often. \n\nAn important feature of AWS Backup is that [tags](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/), access control lists, and other metadata are also saved along with your data. \n\nAn additional layer of security can be added by using the MFA delete feature in AWS. This option requires a successful MFA before allowing a user to delete an object or bucket. \n\nMoreover, you can keep multiple versions of an object inside a bucket. This process is called versioning and can be used to recover objects from accidental deletion. \n\n## Do you have a complete cloud security program? \n\nIn this article, we’ve discussed many possible misconfigurations, along with best practices. However, in order to fully understand your public cloud infrastructure and find vulnerabilities, you need to have good visibility over your cloud environment.  \n\nUsing a new feature in Cyscale, the bucket graph, you can put in context all of your knowledge and grasp a better understanding of your infrastructure. \n\nBelow, you can see an example of a bucket graph. \n\n![Bucket Graph in Cyscale](/img/23_blog-graph-bucket.webp#shadow \"Bucket Graph in Cyscale\")\n\nAlthough the bucket (shown on the right) has only two IAM policies attached, we can see that these have a significant impact on the infrastructure: the AmazonS3FullAccess policy gives full access rights to a specific user and to a VM that can assume an associated IAMRole.  \n\nIn addition, there's a lambda function that has a role which gives it permissions to perform actions on the bucket \n\nWithout context, we would not be able to understand a policy's impact and the associated risk. \n\nMoreover, the icon on the right shows us that the bucket violates three policies. Cyscale users can click on the icon and obtain more details regarding this alert. \n\nThis feature helps you quickly understand and fix any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities introduced in the cloud environment due to the bucket’s settings. \n\n  \n\nBesides the graph, you can also use controls to check your cloud configurations easily. Find any gaps in your buckets' configurations using Cyscale controls! Here are a few examples that can help you instantly check the most common misconfigurations regarding S3 buckets: \n\n* *Ensure S3 bucket ACL grants permissions only to specific AWS accounts* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* \n* *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes* \n* *Ensure that there are no publicly accessible objects in storage buckets* \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","seoTitle":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","description":"A database is one of the most important cloud assets.

It usually stores sensitive information that should be well protected.  \n\nWhen we’re discussing databases in the cloud, there are two options for users. They can: \n\n* manage their own database in the cloud, or \n* use a service provided by their cloud vendor. \n\nThe latter is usually the easier choice since the cloud vendor takes care of security features.  \n\nHowever, your database may be vulnerable in both cases if you don’t configure your environment correctly. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for securing databases in the cloud and how to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that may exist or appear in the future. \n\n## Best practices \n\n### 1. Filter inbound and outbound traffic. \n\nManaging traffic to and from the database is the first layer of database protection. Place databases behind firewalls and restrict the traffic allowed to reach them as much as possible. \n\nYou can implement more granular rules by only allowing a list of known IPs to connect to a database (for example, the range of addresses specific to a known data center), or by filtering traffic based on other criteria. \n\nMoreover, you can apply conditional access for users when administering the database. You can ask for additional security checks like Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure the entities managing the database are legitimate. \n\n### 2. Ensure availability through redundancy \n\nWhen deploying a database in the public cloud, you have the option to ensure availability through redundancy. You can replicate a database in different data centers and even different geographical regions. \n\nIf one data center or region fails, you can rely on a replication of the database located in a different data center to work. \n\n### 3. Encrypt your database \n\nDatabase [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) is important for protecting your data at rest.  \n\nEnsure that only authorized entities can see the data you’re storing in the database by [encrypting it ](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/)with a strong, recommended algorithm such as AES-256. Keep your encryption keys safe by storing them separately from the data, use strong generation algorithms and rotate them every 90 days or less. \n\n### 4. Secure your database connection \n\nNot only data at rest is vulnerable. When you're transferring data to and from the database, it is essential to encrypt your traffic.  \n\nThis is called encryption for data in transit and is implemented with the TLS/SSL protocols. \n\n### 5. Keep your connection details secret \n\nDo not disclose database connection strings, keys, certificates, and other secrets that may be used to breach your database. You can use cloud solutions to keep your cryptographic secrets safe: \n\n* [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) Key Vault, \n* [AWS ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/)Key Management Service (AWS KMS), \n* [Google Cloud ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/)Secret Manager, \n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), and others. \n\n### 6. Log connection attempts \n\nKeep track of who is trying to connect to your database by logging any authentication attempts. In this way, you can see if: \n\n* someone unauthorized is trying to or is connecting to the database, \n* there is a brute-force attack taking place.  \n\n### 7. Perform regular database backups \n\nDatabases should be backed up regularly, to prevent loss of data, in the case of: \n\n* Data corruption, and \n* Ransomware attacks. \n\nAlthough ransomware attacks are less common in cloud environments at the moment, attackers could in time develop the proper tactics. \n\n![RPO and RTO](/img/20_blog-rpo-and-rto.webp#shadow \"RPO and RTO\")\n\nThe time between the backups is known as RPO (Recovery Point Objective). It is measured as the time that passed between the last backup and the current one. If a disaster appears, the data written in that time is lost. \n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the time it takes for an application to go back online after a disaster and to restore its data.   \n\nRTO and RPO should be kept in acceptable limits. \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to ensure you’re implementing all the best practices we mentioned in this article. [Cyscale ](https://cyscale.com/)has over 400 controls that can help you secure your entire cloud environment. \n\nHere are some examples of controls that check for any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities regarding your database setup in the public cloud: \n\n* *Ensure encrypted storage is used for VMs that might host a database* for AWS \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances require all incoming connections to use SSL* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database* for Alibaba Cloud \n\nAlong with these controls that alert you on any findings, you receive remediation steps to quickly eliminate any vulnerabilities and secure your database in the cloud. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","seoTitle":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","description":"Encryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality.

Entities that do not have the decryption key in their possession cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, read its content. \n\n## How does encryption work? \n\nPlaintext data is transformed, using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, to ciphertext, which is unreadable text.  \n\nThere are two types of encryption algorithms: \n\n* Symmetric,  \n* Asymmetric. \n\nIn symmetric algorithms, the key used to perform the encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt it and is, therefore, secret. \n\nExamples of symmetric algorithms are: \n\n* DES (Data Encryption Standard),  \n* 3DES (Triple DES), \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). \n\nThe latter one is, in 2022, the industry standard and is recommended to be used with 128 bits keys. \n\n![Symmetric encryption](/img/blog_17-cisco_encryption.webp#shadow \"Symmetric encryption\")\n\nImage source – cisco.com \n\nAsymmetric algorithms use two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. \n\nAsymmetric algorithm examples are: \n\n* RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), \n* ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). \n\nAsymmetric algorithms are not commonly used for encryption because they are slower. For example, the RSA algorithm requires keys between 1024 and 4096 bits, which slows down the encryption and decryption process.  \n\nThese algorithms can be used, however, to encrypt symmetric algorithm keys when they are distributed. \n\nA more common usage of asymmetric algorithms is digital signatures. They are mathematical algorithms that are used to cryptographically validate the authenticity and integrity of a message or media on the internet. \n\n## What is encryption used for? \n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality of data. The unreadable ciphertext keeps the data private from all parties that do not possess the decryption key. \n\nData has three states: \n\n* In motion, \n* In use, \n* At rest. \n\nIt is essential to understand these states and ensure that the data is always encrypted. It is not enough to encrypt data only when it is stored if, when in transit, a malicious party can still read it.  \n\nTherefore, we will look at encryption mechanisms for all three data states. \n\n### In Motion Encryption \n\nData in motion, or in transit, is data that is moved from one location to another, for example, between: \n\n* computers,  \n* services,  \n* virtual machines,  \n* applications, \n* networks.  \n\nExamples of data in motion are: \n\n* emails, \n* files, \n* messages. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nSSL/TLS ensure confidentiality through encryption. Firstly, a session is created between the two parties exchanging a message using asymmetric encryption. Then, after the secure session is established, symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt the data in motion. \n\nUsing one of the mentioned protocols prevents attackers from reading the data in motion. \n\nWebsites should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP to ensure encryption between websites and browsers. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS. \n\n**What is in motion data vulnerable to?** \n\n**Eavesdropping attacks.** In this situation, malicious entities can analyze traffic sent over the internet and read unencrypted data.   \n\n### In Use Encryption \n\nData currently accessed and used is considered in use.   \n\nExamples of in use data are: \n\n* files that are currently open, \n* databases, \n* RAM data. \n\nBecause data needs to be decrypted to become in use, it is essential that data security is taken care of before the actual use of data begins. \n\nTo do this, you need to ensure a good authentication mechanism. Technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be implemented to increase security. \n\nMoreover, after a user authenticates, access management is necessary. Users should not be allowed to access any available resources, only the ones they need to, in order to perform their job.  \n\nA method of encryption for data in use is Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory using an AES-128 encryption engine and an [AMD EPYC processor](https://developer.amd.com/sev/). Other hardware vendors are also offering memory encryption for data in use, but this area is still relatively new. \n\n**What is in use data vulnerable to?**  \n\nIn use data is vulnerable to **authentication attacks**. These types of attacks are used to gain access to the data by bypassing authentication, brute-forcing or obtaining credentials, and others. \n\nAnother type of attack for data in use is a **cold boot attack**. Even though the RAM memory is considered volatile, after a computer is turned off, it takes a few minutes for that memory to be erased. If kept at low temperatures, RAM memory can be extracted, and, therefore, the last data loaded in the RAM memory can be read. \n\n### At Rest Encryption \n\nOnce data arrives at the destination and is not used, it becomes at rest.  \n\nExamples of data at rest are: \n\n* databases, \n* cloud storage assets such as buckets, \n* files and file archives, \n* USB drives, and others. \n\nThis data state is usually most targeted by attackers who attempt to read databases, steal files stored on the computer, obtain USB drives, and others. \n\nEncryption of data at rest is fairly simple and is usually done using symmetric algorithms. When you perform at rest data encryption, you need to ensure you’re following these best practices: \n\n* you're using an industry-standard algorithm such as AES, \n* you’re using the recommended key size, \n* you’re managing your cryptographic keys properly by not storing your key in the same place and changing it regularly, \n* the key-generating algorithms used to obtain the new key each time are random enough. \n\nFor the examples of data given above, you can have the following encryption schemes: \n\n* full disk encryption, \n* database encryption, \n* file system encryption, \n* cloud assets encryption. \n\nOne important aspect of encryption is cryptographic keys management. You must store your keys safely to ensure confidentiality of your data. \n\nYou can store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM), which are dedicated hardware devices for key management. They are hardened against malware or other types of attacks. \n\nAnother secure solution is storing keys in the cloud, using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\n**What is at rest data vulnerable to?** \n\nAlthough data at rest is the easiest to secure out of all three states, it is usually the point of focus for attackers. There are a few types of attacks data in transit is vulnerable to: \n\n* **Exfiltration attacks.** The most common way at rest data is compromised is through exfiltration attacks, which means that hackers try to steal that data. For this reason, implementing a very robust encryption scheme is important.  <br>Another essential thing to note is that, when data is exfiltrated, even if it is encrypted, attackers can try to brute-force cryptographic keys offline for a long period of time. Therefore a long, random encryption key should be used (and rotated regularly). \n* **Hardware attacks.** If a person loses their laptop, phone, or USB drive and the data stored on them is not encrypted (and the devices are not protected by passwords or have weak passwords), the individual who found the device can read its contents. \n\n## Are you protecting data in all states? \n\nUse Cyscale to ensure that you’re protecting data by taking advantage of over 400 controls. \n\nHere are just a few examples of controls that ensure data security through encryption across different cloud vendors: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure server-side encryption is set to 'Encrypt with Service Key'* for Alibaba \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies","seoTitle":"5 CSPM Best Practices & Strategies - Cyscale","description":"A CSPM product is a component of cloud security that uses controls to identify misconfigurations, sends targeted alerts to companies, provides step on how to remediate findings and helps you achieve compliance with international standards. 5 best practices and strategies are: ensure visibility of assets, classify assets and prioritize the most important ones, achieve compliance with international standards, monitor your infrastructure and ensure logging, remediate findings quickly.

It is developed and deployed in the cloud in its entirety.  \n\nThis type of application is containerized, for example in Docker or Kubernetes, to ensure isolated, dependency-free environments, and most of the time uses microservices to divide tasks and provide granularity.  \n\n**Cloud-based applications** are built and run outside the cloud but have certain features integrated into the cloud. \n\nA **cloud-enabled or non-native application** is originally meant for an on-premises environment. It is built outside the cloud and later transferred into one, in order to enjoy some of its benefits. \n\n<div id=\"advantages\">\n\n## Advantages of going cloud-native\n\n</div>\n\nTo better understand the differences between cloud-native and on-premises apps that do not use cloud, we will look at the former’s advantages and disadvantages over the latter’s.\n\n### Speed \n\nNative applications are easier and faster to build and deploy than on-premises ones because no sophisticated software or hardware requirements need to be fulfilled. Moreover, updates are also implemented faster in a cloud-native architecture and require no downtime.\n\n### Cost \n\nThe cost of using cloud-native technology depends on the application but is generally lower since it does not require the purchase of expensive hardware. For example, instead of buying a computer, you use virtual machines.\n\nTypically, cloud-native applications only require software licenses or subscriptions. \n\n### Scalability \n\nSince cloud-native environments do not require hardware upgrades, they are scalable and adaptable to business requirements. \n\nAccording to [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation), an open source project, “cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications”. \n\n### Resiliency \n\nThe cloud is known for its resiliency against natural disasters, power outages and other incidents that may disrupt a cloud-enabled application. Native cloud workloads are therefore more resilient. \n\n### A serverless model \n\nCloud-native applications may work on a serverless model by leaving the provisioning and maintaining tasks to the cloud provider. This model simplifies the deployment steps and eases the developer's work, increasing productivity. \n\nMoreover, using this model, cloud-native applications can be launched only when needed, the code in serverless functions responding to triggers and consuming resources when necessary. An advantage is that costs are reduced for applications. \n\n<div id=\"guide-to-secure-cloud\">\n\n## How to secure your cloud-native application\n\n</div>\n\nAccording to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/), cloud-native security can be approached in 4 layers, called the 4 C’s: \n\n1. Code, \n2. Container, \n3. Cluster, \n4. Cloud. \n\n### Code \n\nThe inner layer of security refers to the code; it is the part the application’s developer has the most control over, yet it can be one of a hacker's most appealing attack surfaces. \n\nApplication code security is usually an underrated cybersecurity mechanism and neglecting it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Here are a few security practices for securing code: \n\n* **Sanitize input.** This can go a long way and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others. \n* **Use encryption.** Data at rest and data in transit should always be encrypted. Make sure you’re sending application data encrypted through TLS. \n* **Ensure modern cryptography.** Even if you’re using encryption and hashing, make sure that: \n\n  * You’re not using deprecated algorithms, such as DES for encryption and MD5 for hashing, Instead, use AES and SHA-256 or newer, which are the current standards. \n  * You’re storing cryptographic keys safely (and not in the source code). \n  * You’re rotating keys regularly to safeguard against brute-force attacks on them. \n* **Only open the ports you’re using.** Don’t forget open ports, especially on internet-facing applications. This is one of the ways attackers can gain access to the cloud infrastructure and infect it with malware. \n\n### Container \n\nThe next layer of security for native cloud is controlled at the container level. \n\nContainers are virtualization tools which allow you to run applications in isolated environments, separated from the hardware.  \n\nIf your application uses various technologies, you can install any needed packages and resolve dependencies in the container instead of on the host operating system. \n\nAnother useful feature of containers is that you can create container image templates and replicate environments without having to re-install tools and technologies. \n\nThe most known containerization services are Docker and Kubernetes.  \n\nDocker is a platform that enables developers to deploy applications in a containerized environment. Docker runs over a single node (machine), while Kubernetes is a container orchestration service. \n\nDocker and Kubernetes are usually seen as competitors, but they work very well together; Kubernetes can help manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. \n\nHowever, there are a few security issues that need to be addressed regarding containers security: \n\n* **Do not run containers as root.** Developers find it easier to run containers as root because they don't have to provide their password when executing an action that requires root privileges. However, this opens up a wide palette of vulnerabilities; any attacker that would gain access to the container would have root privileges and, therefore, the highest level of permissions. \n* **Reduce the attack surface.** If an attacker gains access to the container, make sure they cannot escalate their privileges or escape the container; eliminate the use of UNIX binaries that can be used to bypass rules, such as \"sed\" and \"awk\". \n* **Implement a strong network policy**—for example, filter traffic to and from the container and use firewalls to ensure robust security. \n\n### Cluster \n\nThe third layer for cloud-native security is managed in clusters. \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It comprises the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining for example which application is running in which container. \n\nThe nodes that are part of a cluster run the applications. \n\nLet’s understand how to protect clusters with the following security solutions:\n\n* **Implement Authentication.** This step requires the user to prove they are who they claim to be. The authentication process may be different from service to service, but it can require credentials like passwords, client certificates, tokens, and others. \n* **Implement Authorization.** Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes authorization by assigning roles to users and managing their privileges at role level to ensure application security. \n* **Control what privileges containers run with.** Establish permissions by using security contexts. These are settings that can be applied to a container or a set of containers inside a cluster that define privileges and access control. \n\n### Cloud \n\nThe outer layer of a cloud-native application refers to cloud infrastructure and configuration. Let’s see how to fix [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and secure your cloud-native application against attackers. \n\n* **Restrict inbound and outbound traffic.** Make sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to blacklist ranges of IPs and ports.  \n* **Ensure compliance with the Least Privilege Principle.** Make sure no user has more privileges than required to carry out their tasks and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n* **Implement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.** Ensure that no one can read databases, files, and other resources if they gain access to your company's cloud. \n\nYou can identify misconfigurations in the cloud and remediate them effectively using the Cyscale security platform.\n\nThe Cyscale Cloud Platform offers a [CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/) security tool that: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities using security controls, \n* provides integration with the most important public cloud service providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, and supports multi-cloud environments,\n* sends relevant alerts,  \n* provides remediation steps to help your security teams protect your cloud environment effectively and overcome security challenges, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","seoTitle":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. Controls in Cyscale check your Okta configurations for the following: if there are at least two Okta admins configured, if application assignments are configured through groups, if MFA is configured and it has strong factors, if there are no weak password policies.","seoDescription":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. It is important to integrate an identity provider with a CSPM to monitor security posture in one single place and see all of your IAM users in context.

If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","seoTitle":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","description":"A CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool is a product that scans your cloud environment for vulnerabilities and alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure.

It alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure. \n\nThis article will discuss what you need to look for in a CSPM and help you make the right choice regarding your [cloud's security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n### Does it check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities? \n\nThere is a long list of possible misconfigurations, policy violations, and mistakes that can disrupt your cloud system. \n\nA good CSPM tool will have controls to check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities and correctly identify any misconfigurations. \n\nSome of [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) are: \n\n* Poor storage access configuration, \n* Broken access control, \n* Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, \n* Missing encryption, \n* Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\n### Does it have an integration with your preferred cloud platform? \n\nThe CSPM tool you choose must be compatible with the cloud platform your system is using. The top three vendors in the cloud industry are: \n\n* [Amazon Web Services Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) \n* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) \n* [Microsoft Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) \n\nWith Cyscale, you can scan and maintain your cloud security posture for all three of the vendors mentioned above, as well as Alibaba Cloud. \n\nAnother essential feature is that Cyscale integrates Okta identities. \n\n### What compliance frameworks does it support? \n\nA certificate of [compliance with a standard such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) can be an asset because it advertises the following things about your company: \n\n* You understand the significance of cybersecurity, \n* Your organization is working to reduce the risk of information security breaches, \n* You are adequately managing information security. \n\nIn order to make the best use of your [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), take into account what compliance standard or certification your company is going for. A few examples are: \n\n* ISO 27001 \n* SOC 2 \n* NIST 800-53 \n* PCI-DSS \n* CIS \n* GDPR \n\nSome standards require you to write your own policies such as Data Protection or Disaster Recovery.  \n\nYou can manage them using traditional tools such as Microsoft Word and Sharepoint, or you can use a powerful policy editor and gain inline evidence collection offered by Cyscale. \n\n### Is the CSPM providing vulnerability and risk scoring? \n\nPrioritization of issues and risk scoring is an essential feature of a CSPM. \n\nAssigning risk levels to assets and prioritizing remediation can significantly increase a company's security. \n\nVulnerability scoring is another essential feature that can help you avoid false positives and prioritize tasks. Time is crucial when discussing vulnerabilities, so quick actions need to be taken to prevent breaches. \n\nThis is why it is essential to ensure that false positives are avoided because they can cause noise that may distract employees from more important matters. \n\n![Alerts divided by severity](/img/alerts-severity.webp#shadow \"Risk scoring in Cyscale\")\n\n### Do you receive targeted alerts? \n\nReceiving thousands of alerts can be overwhelming. Your CSPM tool needs to filter them and send relevant, targeted alerts. \n\nCyscale currently has two types of notifications that can be customized to your preference: \n\n1. Security Posture. These weekly digests show you your cloud security posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count. You can see an example below. \n\n![A Security Posture email showing a posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count](/img/security-posture.webp#shadow \"Security Posture Email from Cyscale\")\n\n2. Alerts. They are sent in batches for a given cloud account in a single email to ensure that they do not become overwhelming. These alerts inform you of new vulnerabilities found in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nBesides these personal notifications sent to your email, you can also enable alerts on Slack, Teams, or an app of your choice, by using Webhook. \n\n### Does it provide remediation for found vulnerabilities? \n\nFinding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure is just the first step. \n\nApplying the correct remediation before it becomes a breach is critical to securing your cloud.  \n\nCyscale provides, along with the controls that pinpoint what vulnerability has been identified, the following: \n\n* an explanation of the cause of the control failure, \n* how the vulnerability was identified, \n* remediation steps. \n\nThe remediation steps can ensure you're applying the modifications correctly and speed up the process of securing your assets. \n\nMake the right decision for your company by using a robust CSPM that helps secure your cloud infrastructure and provides all of the features mentioned above and more. \n\nCyscale ensures the following features: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities, \n* integration with AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, Okta, \n* support for compliance frameworks and standards, \n* prioritization of assets remediation and alerts, \n* targeted and custom alerts, \n* remediation steps and vulnerabilities reports. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":18,"numPages":4,"currentPage":3,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","IAM","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
