Network administrators in legacy systems invest significant effort into securing routers, adding firewalls and ensuring that all network devices function correctly. In the cloud, under the shared responsibility model, the customer does not deal with physical devices anymore, and security is shifted to identity and access control, known as [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), which focuses on the prevention of unauthorized users and devices from accessing cloud assets.  \n\n## Why is IAM important? \n\nIf a user with high privileges is compromised in the cloud, a situation can escalate to critical levels quickly leaving vulnerable apps and data exposed; this is why IAM is the first and most important line of defense against attackers.  \n\n## How do you manage IAM in the cloud? \n\nNowadays, every employee has multiple accounts for different tools they use, such as HR applications, a CRM or ERP solution, various cloud platforms, and more. We do not live in a world where one person equals one account to manage, meaning the process of securing access is complicated from the start.  \n\nA single developer or other IT employee might need to have access to multiple cloud environments, a version control system, a deployment platform, and a ticket management system, and if you multiply that by 10 or 100 employees the number of accounts or users you need to manage is quickly getting into the hundreds or thousands.  \n\nIt’s impossible to manually handle so many accounts and ensure that they’re all properly secured, granted appropriate permissions, and correctly deprovisioned when employees leave.  \n\n### Key IAM processes: The access management lifecycle   \n\nLet’s take a look at the key stages in the access management lifecycle, keeping in mind that these processes need to apply to the individual and all the user accounts they are associated with: \n\n* **Onboarding:** the first stage involves creating a new user, assigning roles to it and providing permissions over resources. \n* **Role management:** in this stage, roles are already defined and configured for users. New roles and permissions may be added based on needs. \n* **Access review:** these are periodic evaluations of permissions assigned to users, groups, or roles. This stage involves reviewing and validating that individuals or entities have appropriate access levels based on their current roles and responsibilities. \n* **Offboarding:** This stage is crucial and involves removing users from the company's systems, revoking permissions and disabling accounts, thus preventing unauthorized access after an individual leaves the organization. \n\n### Centralizing IAM processes in the cloud \n\nIn order to handle an impossible workload and ensure due process is followed each and every time, centralization has become key. Let’s look at best practices to secure [IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) throughout the identity lifecycle. \n\n### SSO (Single Sign-On) \n\nOften, companies will deploy multiple cloud accounts, and the best practice is to organize these using provider specific mechanisms (ie. Organizations and Folders in AWS, Management Groups in Azure, etc.). Managing identities at cloud account level would quickly become unmanageable and it’s best to keep those at a minimum. \n\nA cloud company should use an identity provider (whether that’s one built-in into the cloud service provider, such as Azure AD, or an external SSO provider, like [Okta](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-okta-security-best-practices/)) to manage cloud access, as opposed to having multiple users defined within individual cloud accounts. \n\nManaging identities in a central location, as well as using SSO, are key elements of ensuring IAM security in the cloud. These are the risks of not using SSO in your company: \n\n1. **Password fatigue leading to security issues.** Having users input their passwords multiple times a day and for different applications can and probably will lead to them re-using the same password across multiple platforms or using very simple, easy to remember passwords. No-one wants to pull out the password manager 20 times a day. Password fatigue can lead to credentials leak and may put a company in danger.  \n2. **Long-term credentials accidentally disclosed or stolen.** Managing cloud access at individual account level implies creating long-term credentials such as passwords or access keys. Through SSO, temporary credentials are used and they expire after the user's session. This helps mitigate the risk of long-term credential exposure, because even if these temporary credentials were to be leaked, they would only be valid for a short period.\n3. **It’s overall a better user experience.**  \n\n### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) \n\nThis is considered essential. To clarify the point: your employees should not have any accounts without MFA. Whether they’re using a passwordless solution, or still using passwords, MFA should be enabled for everyone, but especially for high-privilege users.  \n\nWe can’t labor this point enough. There are so many breaches that could have been prevented with MFA! For example, [Deloitte suffered an incident in 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails) where the company’s clients were affected just because an administrative account did not have MFA. Emails, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and even health data were at risk. \n\nIn 2014, Home Depot had an estimated 56 million payment cards exposed after a third-party vendor’s stolen login details were used to breach the company. Again, MFA could have prevented such a breach. \n\nIf you’re already using SSO in your company, you should enforce an MFA policy at the identity provider level and better manage this setting for all your users. \n\nWe even demonstrated how MFA can prevent an attack from spreading in an Azure cloud environment, you can read that article [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/compromising-azure-cloud-as-guest/). \n\nBeware however that threat actors are innovating in this space too. A newish social engineering type approach known as an MFA Fatigue attack sees hackers relentlessly pushing MFA access requests to users’ endpoint devices and combining this with stolen logins to try and wear down a user to the point where they accidently allow access.  \n\n### Get full visibility of users and accounts \n\nYou can’t secure what you can’t see (or you don’t know about). So, it’s impossible to have a good security posture in the cloud without full visibility of all your assets, your people and their respective user accounts, role assignments, groups, and so on. \n\nThis is why a centralized solution for access review is the best approach to managing this challenge: having all permissions, roles, and user accounts visible via one single dashboard is very attractive for security professionals trying to manage access in the cloud. \n\nIn the image below we notice how one single person has permissions over Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, GitHub, and other environments. Besides this, we see the effective permissions assigned to each cloud account or application, security information such as the password’s lifetime and whether MFA is activated; this information would normally be spread out across multiple consoles and hard to follow. \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" title=\"The Cyscale IAM dashboard.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nUsing this dashboard, you can review users’ access in a timely manner, without missing important information. You can go through users one by one and review the permissions they have, instead of circling through groups and permissions trying to figure out what users inherit based on their group assignment. \n\nAfter configuring your cloud environment and assigning roles and permissions, an IAM dashboard like the one in the image above can help you to identify any gaps left in your cloud user management and should be treated as best practice.  \n\n### Finding and resolving excessive permissions \n\nIdentifying users with excessive permissions can help prevent an attacker from escalating privileges in a cloud environment. You can use PIM (Privileged Identity Management) to assign high privileges for a limited amount of time to users and therefore limit the attack surface.  \n\nFollow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) when configuring users’ roles and permissions to ensure that they do not have access to resources they don’t need to use. \n\nIn the previous section, we looked at an IAM dashboard and identified how many user accounts a single person has. On the right-hand side of the dashboard, we can see a “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/56_blog-edited-screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" title=\"A “Highly privileged” tag next to the Azure account.\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe user ‘John’ has a Contributor role over the second subscription in Azure, revealing a wide range of permissions. This user has full access to manage all resources, meaning he can modify and delete resources. Alarm bells should start ringing here because if this user were to be compromised, the entire Azure environment would be at risk.\n\n### Best practices for identity and access control  \n\nEffective IAM is crucial in today's cloud security landscape. From getting full visibility over assets, people, user accounts and permissions from the start, to good hygiene at every stage of the identity lifecycle, the guidance above will help you establish a strong strategy.  \n\nUse this checklist below to tick off the key elements that can, together with a centralized identity and access management approach, help improve your cloud security: \n\n* Deploy an effective onboarding and role management process \n* Review permissions frequently \n* Enforce a strong password policy \n* Adopt SSO \n* Enforce MFA \n* Achieve full visibility of assets, people and users \n* Apply the Least Privilege Principle \n* Deploy an effective offboarding process \n* Centralize IAM"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","description":"The future of cloud security is contextual security.

And although companies were reluctant to put their infrastructure and applications in the hands of a different company, cloud solutions have grown in popularity.  \n\nWith more and more complex setups, it is hard for an organization to understand and keep track of the implication of every resource they have in the cloud, the risk it poses to the entire infrastructure or how many other assets it impacts. \n\nI believe the future of cloud security is contextual security. To fully understand how secure an asset is, you need to understand what users have permissions to interact with it and what resources it communicates with. It might seem that a VM is completely secure because you put it behind a firewall, but if a compromised user can access it, it’s game over. \n\nThe perfect recipe for contextual security is a [Cloud Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/). Based on it, we can represent in a visual and interactive way how cloud resources interact, what kind of relations they have, what users have permissions to read/write on them, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate my point, I will show you some scenarios where the difference between a secure cloud and a breach is made by fixing misconfigurations and limiting users' access. These measures are easier to identify using a graph, because it helps you understand the risks your environment is exposed to.  \n\n## Case Study \n\nLet’s assume we use BigQuery in Google Cloud for a health analytics application. We have a table that contains some datasets of patients from a hospital, including PII data. These datasets are very valuable and cannot fall in the hands of outsiders. \n\nNow, we want to make sure that the data is securely stored. We look at the BigQuery table’s graph to see if the table poses any risk and, low and behold, it does! \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-graf0.png\" alt=\"Contextual security through the graph\" title=\"Contextual security through the graph\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe can observe, in the image above, that no less than 7 Cloud Functions and 4 VMs can access it across 9 Service Accounts that have permissions on the BigQueryTable, as well as 7 IAM Users. Does this alarm you? It should. \n\nBut just because a VM, or a function, can have access to the table does not mean anything, right? Wrong! I’m going to show you exactly how bad things can get in this situation. I’m going to put my hacker shoes on and show you potential scenarios that might lead to data being stolen. \n\n### Scenario 1: compromised VM \n\nOut of the 4 VMs that we see in the image, one is an Internet-facing one. The compute instance “dev-1” hosts an application that has the Log4J vulnerability, a classic. A hacker leverages the vulnerability and gains access to the instance. If they take over an IAMUser with the Compute Instance Admin role, or obtain SSH access to the VM, the disaster begins. **Because a Service Account is associated to the VM, the attacker has that account’s permissions.** In our scenario, the application running on the Instance needs to process data in the dataset, so the associated Service Account was given the roles/bigquery.dataEditor permission. \n\nMoreover, in a VM, credentials used to manually authenticate are stored on the Compute Instance after the first time a user authenticates as a Service Account, in */.config/gcloud/credentials.db*, as you can see in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss1.png\" alt=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" title=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThis is a standard location and it stores the last private key that was used to authenticate as a Service Account.  You can also find access tokens in the same folder, in *access_tokens.db*. Moreover, you can see any other private keys used previously (which may still be valid, if they were not deleted in the Google Cloud Console) in */.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/<serviceAccountEmail>/adc.json*. \n\nLooking at the file credentials.db, we notice that the information is not stored in the standard format for a private key for a Service Account. With a few adjustments, we obtain a valid private key that we then use to authenticate. To authenticate as a Service Account with a private key, simply use the following command:  \n\n```\ngcloud auth activate-service-account <serviceAccountEmail> --key-file=<keyFile>\n```\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss2.png\" alt=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" title=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, what happens when no one has authenticated as a Service Account on the VM? There is no *credentials.db* file (actually, there is no *.config* folder).  \n\nDevelopers tend to find ways to do things faster, and they get comfortable. It is not uncommon to find secrets in environment variables or plain-text files. If a developer were to store a secret key file on the Compute Instance, we could abuse it. Simply log in using the private RSA key file: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss3.png\" alt=\"Private key on the VM\" title=\"Private key on the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss4.png\" alt=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" title=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nChecking the current permissions, and… bingo! roles/bigquery.dataEditor is one of the available roles. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss5.png\" alt=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" title=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we expand the graph’s nodes that we used in this chain of attacks, you can clearly see the attack path: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-primul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through the VM\" title=\"Attack path through the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the bigquery.dataEditor role, the attacker can now: \n\n* view data and metadata, \n* modify data and metadata, \n* delete tables. \n\n This breach could be avoided by: \n\n* ensuring the VM does not have vulnerabilities, and patching the Log4J one, \n* isolating the Compute Instance from the Internet by closing the exposed port, if possible, \n* restricting the Service Account’s permissions as much as possible,\n* making sure secrets are cleared from the VM files.   \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss6.png\" alt=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" title=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### Scenario 2: compromised user \n\nExpanding the Users node, we see that there are three users that have access to the BigQueryTable.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ultimul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through user compromise\" title=\"Attack path through user compromise\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf a hacker were to take over any of those accounts, for example, by stealing credentials, our customer’s data would be at risk. If one of the three users that have access to the table does not have MFA enforced, then the attacker can compromise the account.  \n\nEnabling MFA would prevent this. \n\nBesides this, a common mistake is focusing on protecting your environment from the outside, and forgetting about your own users. If one of the employees in the organization has too many permissions, they may produce damage without intention. By exploring the account and looking at resources, a user can accidentally modify or delete an asset. \n\nThis is why the Least Privilege Principle is so important – always limit the users’ access as much as possible and only assign the necessary permissions. \n\nWe believe that context is the future of cloud security. We’ve seen how the most simple relations between assets can be leveraged by attackers to take over cloud assets; and if your customers’ data is stored in those assets, the greater the prize is for hackers – and they will do anything to get it."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Understanding Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): An Essential Guide","seoTitle":"Understanding Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM): An Essential Guide","description":"Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) is a critical component of secure cloud computing practices.

It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers: \n\n* Real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, \n* A comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, \n* An overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, \n* Remediation solutions for findings, and many others. \n\nA CSPM is a solution that modern security teams use to proactively identify and fix security issues in their cloud infrastructure to ensure a strong security posture in the cloud. \n\n## A day in the life with CSPM \n\nWhat does a day in the life of a cloud security professional using a CSPM look like? First of all, we must see what it was like *before adopting a CSPM tool*. \n\nFrom manual security checks that take hours, to identifying and fixing compliance gaps, professionals may experience pressure in trying to secure the entire cloud environment. \n\nWith a CSPM, a cloud security team member can be more efficient. They may follow this workflow: \n\n1. The day starts by looking at open alerts and prioritizing the most important and impactful fixes. Using the remediation guidelines provided by the CSPM solution, they would solve some of the issues; \n2. The next step would be researching and understanding how to solve more complex problems identified by the CSPM: by looking at diagrams and dashboards, the user would gain enhanced visibility on how cloud resources are configured and relate to one another; \n3. If the company is going through an audit for a standard, such as ISO 27001 or PCI-DSS, they would assist their compliance colleagues with proper reporting and fixing any existing gaps; a low compliance score highlighted by the CSPM would indicate on which specific area they and the compliance team should focus on to improve the score. \n\nNow, using a comprehensive CSPM solution, confidence and control are gained. Notice how the cloud security professional is no longer spending time on security checks, but rather on actions that have an impact over the company’s cloud security posture. \n\nA CSPM tool has the following capabilities: \n\n### 1. Misconfigurations checks automation \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nOne common way in which scans are performed is controls. Security controls are based on recommendations and best practices; through them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nSome examples of common misconfigurations a CSPM looks for are: \n\n* An S3 bucket that should not be publicly accessible is, and anyone has READ or WRITE permissions on it, \n* The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port for a VM is open and can be accessed from the Internet, \n* Logging is disabled for cloud resources, thus unauthorized access cannot be detected. \n\nControls are among the most significant features you can find in a CSPM solution. Controls are based on security recommendations and best practices; using them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: from databases to buckets, from security groups to web applications, they cover a wide range of configurations and the result of using them surpasses any manual work that could be done. \n\n### 2. A robust alert system  \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nA good alert system can make a difference by reducing or eliminating false positives, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, and enabling understanding by adding context to findings. In this way, detected security issues are solved quickly, and *[alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/)* is avoided.  \n\nMoreover, a CSPM solution has integration with notification channels and ticketing systems to notify its users of findings. This feature is very useful for security teams because it streamlines the process and allows them to view urgent problems directly in the apps they use, such as Slack or Jira. \n\n### 3. Contextual visibility \n\nWithout proper visibility, a cloud security professional that intends to apply security best practices might do so in places with low impact, while higher risk items remain unaddressed. \n\nFor example, a company may have a VM running an application with a Log4Shell vulnerability, and multiple Internet-facing cloud resources that have less critical vulnerabilities. The VM may be prioritized because this type of vulnerability is severe and well-known. However, if that VM runs on a private network and is not accessible from the Internet, then the prioritization is not ideal, and Internet-facing applications and devices are neglected. \n\n### 4. Remediation steps \n\nA good CSPM solution aids security teams in their process of securing a cloud environment. \n\nDetailed remediation steps do not miss from CSPM software. Recommendations on how to fix findings include: \n\n* A series of actions a cloud security professional must execute in order to solve the identified problem, \n* A set of commands that fix the found issue, that can be used in a command line, \n* Recommended reading materials that could help the cloud security professional understand the problem on a deeper level and avoid it in the future. \n\n### 5. Compliance aid \n\nA company that seeks to achieve compliance with a certain standard or regulation must face a long and tedious journey, because this usually entails reviewing organizational, as well as technology-related practices, producing a lot of documentation in the form of policies and procedures, and ultimately ensuring that any system that comes in contact with customer data has appropriate security controls in place.  \n\nA CSPM tool eases this process by measuring the cloud security posture against the required state and providing compliance scoring. Moreover, after passing an audit, CSPMs can help companies stay compliant and ensure they’re following all security recommendations. \n\n### 6. Multi-cloud coverage \n\nWith CSPMs, you don’t need to monitor your infrastructure in a different place for each cloud service provider you’re using; CSPM tools are *[multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/)*!

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor Google Cloud: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud-Native Infrastructure: How to Build a Comprehensive Security Plan","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Infrastructure: How to Build a Comprehensive Security Plan","description":"As more organizations adopt a cloud-native approach to support their business operations, security may sometimes be left out of their initial plans.

This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud apps, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM (virtual machine) if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan for application development. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system for your cloud-native applications. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nIf you have a robust security posture, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of native apps and shift their attention to important aspects. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale cloud platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple public cloud service providers such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time, even if you’re using multi-cloud workloads.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","seoTitle":"Types of Encryption for in Motion, in Use, at Rest Data ","description":"Encryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality.

Entities that do not have the decryption key in their possession cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, read its content. \n\n## How does encryption work? \n\nPlaintext data is transformed, using an encryption algorithm and a secret key, to ciphertext, which is unreadable text.  \n\nThere are two types of encryption algorithms: \n\n* Symmetric,  \n* Asymmetric. \n\nIn symmetric algorithms, the key used to perform the encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt it and is, therefore, secret. \n\nExamples of symmetric algorithms are: \n\n* DES (Data Encryption Standard),  \n* 3DES (Triple DES), \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). \n\nThe latter one is, in 2022, the industry standard and is recommended to be used with 128 bits keys. \n\n![Symmetric encryption](/img/blog_17-cisco_encryption.webp#shadow \"Symmetric encryption\")\n\nImage source – cisco.com \n\nAsymmetric algorithms use two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. \n\nAsymmetric algorithm examples are: \n\n* RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), \n* ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). \n\nAsymmetric algorithms are not commonly used for encryption because they are slower. For example, the RSA algorithm requires keys between 1024 and 4096 bits, which slows down the encryption and decryption process.  \n\nThese algorithms can be used, however, to encrypt symmetric algorithm keys when they are distributed. \n\nA more common usage of asymmetric algorithms is digital signatures. They are mathematical algorithms that are used to cryptographically validate the authenticity and integrity of a message or media on the internet. \n\n## What is encryption used for? \n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality of data. The unreadable ciphertext keeps the data private from all parties that do not possess the decryption key. \n\nData has three states: \n\n* In motion, \n* In use, \n* At rest. \n\nIt is essential to understand these states and ensure that the data is always encrypted. It is not enough to encrypt data only when it is stored if, when in transit, a malicious party can still read it.  \n\nTherefore, we will look at encryption mechanisms for all three data states. \n\n### In Motion Encryption \n\nData in motion, or in transit, is data that is moved from one location to another, for example, between: \n\n* computers,  \n* services,  \n* virtual machines,  \n* applications, \n* networks.  \n\nExamples of data in motion are: \n\n* emails, \n* files, \n* messages. \n\nData in motion can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n\nSSL/TLS ensure confidentiality through encryption. Firstly, a session is created between the two parties exchanging a message using asymmetric encryption. Then, after the secure session is established, symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt the data in motion. \n\nUsing one of the mentioned protocols prevents attackers from reading the data in motion. \n\nWebsites should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP to ensure encryption between websites and browsers. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS. \n\n**What is in motion data vulnerable to?** \n\n**Eavesdropping attacks.** In this situation, malicious entities can analyze traffic sent over the internet and read unencrypted data.   \n\n### In Use Encryption \n\nData currently accessed and used is considered in use.   \n\nExamples of in use data are: \n\n* files that are currently open, \n* databases, \n* RAM data. \n\nBecause data needs to be decrypted to become in use, it is essential that data security is taken care of before the actual use of data begins. \n\nTo do this, you need to ensure a good authentication mechanism. Technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be implemented to increase security. \n\nMoreover, after a user authenticates, access management is necessary. Users should not be allowed to access any available resources, only the ones they need to, in order to perform their job.  \n\nA method of encryption for data in use is Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory using an AES-128 encryption engine and an [AMD EPYC processor](https://developer.amd.com/sev/). Other hardware vendors are also offering memory encryption for data in use, but this area is still relatively new. \n\n**What is in use data vulnerable to?**  \n\nIn use data is vulnerable to **authentication attacks**. These types of attacks are used to gain access to the data by bypassing authentication, brute-forcing or obtaining credentials, and others. \n\nAnother type of attack for data in use is a **cold boot attack**. Even though the RAM memory is considered volatile, after a computer is turned off, it takes a few minutes for that memory to be erased. If kept at low temperatures, RAM memory can be extracted, and, therefore, the last data loaded in the RAM memory can be read. \n\n### At Rest Encryption \n\nOnce data arrives at the destination and is not used, it becomes at rest.  \n\nExamples of data at rest are: \n\n* databases, \n* cloud storage assets such as buckets, \n* files and file archives, \n* USB drives, and others. \n\nThis data state is usually most targeted by attackers who attempt to read databases, steal files stored on the computer, obtain USB drives, and others. \n\nEncryption of data at rest is fairly simple and is usually done using symmetric algorithms. When you perform at rest data encryption, you need to ensure you’re following these best practices: \n\n* you're using an industry-standard algorithm such as AES, \n* you’re using the recommended key size, \n* you’re managing your cryptographic keys properly by not storing your key in the same place and changing it regularly, \n* the key-generating algorithms used to obtain the new key each time are random enough. \n\nFor the examples of data given above, you can have the following encryption schemes: \n\n* full disk encryption, \n* database encryption, \n* file system encryption, \n* cloud assets encryption. \n\nOne important aspect of encryption is cryptographic keys management. You must store your keys safely to ensure confidentiality of your data. \n\nYou can store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM), which are dedicated hardware devices for key management. They are hardened against malware or other types of attacks. \n\nAnother secure solution is storing keys in the cloud, using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\n**What is at rest data vulnerable to?** \n\nAlthough data at rest is the easiest to secure out of all three states, it is usually the point of focus for attackers. There are a few types of attacks data in transit is vulnerable to: \n\n* **Exfiltration attacks.** The most common way at rest data is compromised is through exfiltration attacks, which means that hackers try to steal that data.

Ensure visibility of assets\n\nIf you have a large number of assets, it is challenging to guarantee discovery and visibility and to find security design issues. \n\nBroad visibility and discovery of assets may help you identify: \n\n* misconfigurations that may cause vulnerabilities in your system, \n* poor access control, \n* weak data security, and others. \n\nBelow, you can see a section of Cyscale’s powerful dashboard, where you can also find the status of your controls, alerts, and others. \n\nThis inventory helps you keep track of assets and be aware of the different components in your cloud environment. \n\n![Dashboard inventory in Cyscale](/img/inventory-dashboard.webp#shadow \"Dashboard inventory in Cyscale\")\n\n#### 2. Classify assets and prioritize the most important ones\n\nAsset classification is very important; it will help you prioritize the assets with high risk and high importance. \n\nA company's security can be considerably improved by categorizing assets according to their risk and by setting remediation priorities. \n\n#### 3. Achieve compliance with frameworks such as GDPR, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, and others.\n\nA CSPM can help you achieve compliance by: \n\nensuring your cloud environment is implementing requirements and best practices,  \n\nproviding evidence of your organization’s efforts and speeding up the auditing process. \n\nThere is a long list of international standards that regulate configurations of cloud environments: \n\n* ISO 27001,  \n* GDPR,  \n* HIPAA, \n* PCI-DSS, \n* NIST, and many more. \n\n![International compliance standards](/img/standards.webp#shadow \"International compliance standards\")\n\n#### 4. Monitor your infrastructure\n\nIdentifying threats early is crucial to preventing incidents. Keep logs and document every action and event to be able to respond to threats as they appear. \n\nMonitoring and logging your infrastructure can help you: \n\n* notice odd behavior, \n* identify misconfigurations, \n* provide accountability for employees’ and customers’ actions. \n\n#### 5. Remediate findings quickly\n\nSolving misconfigurations and responding to incidents promptly is essential – it can prevent a threat from becoming a breach.  \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are:  \n\n* implementing strong encryption for sensitive data, \n* eliminating administrator or root accounts that are not necessary, \n* using access lists and policies to restrict unwanted traffic. \n\nA CSPM can help you remediate failed controls and quickly patch your systems. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that can help you implement the best practices described in this article and even more.

It is developed and deployed in the cloud in its entirety.  \n\nThis type of application is containerized, for example in Docker or Kubernetes, to ensure isolated, dependency-free environments, and most of the time uses microservices to divide tasks and provide granularity.  \n\n**Cloud-based applications** are built and run outside the cloud but have certain features integrated into the cloud. \n\nA **cloud-enabled or non-native application** is originally meant for an on-premises environment. It is built outside the cloud and later transferred into one, in order to enjoy some of its benefits. \n\n<div id=\"advantages\">\n\n## Advantages of going cloud-native\n\n</div>\n\nTo better understand the differences between cloud-native and on-premises apps that do not use cloud, we will look at the former’s advantages and disadvantages over the latter’s.\n\n### Speed \n\nNative applications are easier and faster to build and deploy than on-premises ones because no sophisticated software or hardware requirements need to be fulfilled. Moreover, updates are also implemented faster in a cloud-native architecture and require no downtime.\n\n### Cost \n\nThe cost of using cloud-native technology depends on the application but is generally lower since it does not require the purchase of expensive hardware. For example, instead of buying a computer, you use virtual machines.\n\nTypically, cloud-native applications only require software licenses or subscriptions. \n\n### Scalability \n\nSince cloud-native environments do not require hardware upgrades, they are scalable and adaptable to business requirements. \n\nAccording to [CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md) (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation), an open source project, “cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications”. \n\n### Resiliency \n\nThe cloud is known for its resiliency against natural disasters, power outages and other incidents that may disrupt a cloud-enabled application. Native cloud workloads are therefore more resilient. \n\n### A serverless model \n\nCloud-native applications may work on a serverless model by leaving the provisioning and maintaining tasks to the cloud provider. This model simplifies the deployment steps and eases the developer's work, increasing productivity. \n\nMoreover, using this model, cloud-native applications can be launched only when needed, the code in serverless functions responding to triggers and consuming resources when necessary. An advantage is that costs are reduced for applications. \n\n<div id=\"guide-to-secure-cloud\">\n\n## How to secure your cloud-native application\n\n</div>\n\nAccording to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/), cloud-native security can be approached in 4 layers, called the 4 C’s: \n\n1. Code, \n2. Container, \n3. Cluster, \n4. Cloud. \n\n### Code \n\nThe inner layer of security refers to the code; it is the part the application’s developer has the most control over, yet it can be one of a hacker's most appealing attack surfaces. \n\nApplication code security is usually an underrated cybersecurity mechanism and neglecting it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Here are a few security practices for securing code: \n\n* **Sanitize input.** This can go a long way and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and others. \n* **Use encryption.** Data at rest and data in transit should always be encrypted. Make sure you’re sending application data encrypted through TLS. \n* **Ensure modern cryptography.** Even if you’re using encryption and hashing, make sure that: \n\n  * You’re not using deprecated algorithms, such as DES for encryption and MD5 for hashing, Instead, use AES and SHA-256 or newer, which are the current standards. \n  * You’re storing cryptographic keys safely (and not in the source code). \n  * You’re rotating keys regularly to safeguard against brute-force attacks on them. \n* **Only open the ports you’re using.** Don’t forget open ports, especially on internet-facing applications. This is one of the ways attackers can gain access to the cloud infrastructure and infect it with malware. \n\n### Container \n\nThe next layer of security for native cloud is controlled at the container level. \n\nContainers are virtualization tools which allow you to run applications in isolated environments, separated from the hardware.  \n\nIf your application uses various technologies, you can install any needed packages and resolve dependencies in the container instead of on the host operating system. \n\nAnother useful feature of containers is that you can create container image templates and replicate environments without having to re-install tools and technologies. \n\nThe most known containerization services are Docker and Kubernetes.  \n\nDocker is a platform that enables developers to deploy applications in a containerized environment. Docker runs over a single node (machine), while Kubernetes is a container orchestration service. \n\nDocker and Kubernetes are usually seen as competitors, but they work very well together; Kubernetes can help manage multiple Docker containers simultaneously. \n\nHowever, there are a few security issues that need to be addressed regarding containers security: \n\n* **Do not run containers as root.** Developers find it easier to run containers as root because they don't have to provide their password when executing an action that requires root privileges. However, this opens up a wide palette of vulnerabilities; any attacker that would gain access to the container would have root privileges and, therefore, the highest level of permissions. \n* **Reduce the attack surface.** If an attacker gains access to the container, make sure they cannot escalate their privileges or escape the container; eliminate the use of UNIX binaries that can be used to bypass rules, such as \"sed\" and \"awk\". \n* **Implement a strong network policy**—for example, filter traffic to and from the container and use firewalls to ensure robust security. \n\n### Cluster \n\nThe third layer for cloud-native security is managed in clusters. \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It comprises the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining for example which application is running in which container. \n\nThe nodes that are part of a cluster run the applications. \n\nLet’s understand how to protect clusters with the following security solutions:\n\n* **Implement Authentication.** This step requires the user to prove they are who they claim to be. The authentication process may be different from service to service, but it can require credentials like passwords, client certificates, tokens, and others. \n* **Implement Authorization.** Role-based access control (RBAC) establishes authorization by assigning roles to users and managing their privileges at role level to ensure application security. \n* **Control what privileges containers run with.** Establish permissions by using security contexts. These are settings that can be applied to a container or a set of containers inside a cluster that define privileges and access control. \n\n### Cloud \n\nThe outer layer of a cloud-native application refers to cloud infrastructure and configuration. Let’s see how to fix [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) and secure your cloud-native application against attackers. \n\n* **Restrict inbound and outbound traffic.** Make sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to blacklist ranges of IPs and ports.  \n* **Ensure compliance with the Least Privilege Principle.** Make sure no user has more privileges than required to carry out their tasks and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n* **Implement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.** Ensure that no one can read databases, files, and other resources if they gain access to your company's cloud. \n\nYou can identify misconfigurations in the cloud and remediate them effectively using the Cyscale security platform.\n\nThe Cyscale Cloud Platform offers a [CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/) security tool that: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities using security controls, \n* provides integration with the most important public cloud service providers like AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, and supports multi-cloud environments,\n* sends relevant alerts,  \n* provides remediation steps to help your security teams protect your cloud environment effectively and overcome security challenges, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","seoTitle":"Providing Visibility Over Cloud Access – Okta Integration in Cyscale","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. Controls in Cyscale check your Okta configurations for the following: if there are at least two Okta admins configured, if application assignments are configured through groups, if MFA is configured and it has strong factors, if there are no weak password policies.","seoDescription":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud that connects persons with applications through SSO, AD, LDAP MFA, B2B Integration, Mobile Identity Management, User Management etc. It is important to integrate an identity provider with a CSPM to monitor security posture in one single place and see all of your IAM users in context.

If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":2,"currentPage":1,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","IAM","CNAPP","Misconfigurations"],"categorySlug":"cspm"}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
