Protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance has become paramount for professionals like Solutions Architects, CISOs, Cloud Security Researchers, DevOps Engineers, and others in the technology space tasked with ensuring transformative technologies remain secure. \n\nBut what exactly are the top cloud security challenges, and why are they a matter of pressing concern? Whether its data breaches caused by cyberattacks or vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, cloud security threats are multifaceted and evolving, quickly outpacing our human ability to keep up. \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top 10 cloud security challenges and present a roadmap for creating a robust cloud security strategy, with real-life examples, actionable solutions, and insights to aid your journey towards a secure cloud. \n\n## Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges \n\nThe digital landscape is filled with opportunities, but it is not without its obstacles. Cloud security challenges represent significant hurdles that organizations must overcome to fully leverage the power of cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet's dive into the top 10 challenges that are shaping the conversation in 2023: \n\n### 1. Vulnerabilities in Cloud Infrastructure: \n\nThe rise of cloud computing has unveiled a plethora of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Whether it's poorly designed APIs or weak authentication protocols, these vulnerabilities are often the entry points for unauthorized access. \n\nThe famous [Equifax data breach in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) occurred due to a vulnerability in an Apache Struts framework that allowed attackers to leak data using a vulnerable API. That breach affected approximately 147 million customers. \n\n### 2. Security Threats from Hackers and Malware: \n\nHackers continually evolve their techniques to breach cloud security defenses or simply take services offline. From sophisticated malware to phishing attacks and holding services to ransom, the threats are relentless and require constant vigilance and real-time security solutions.  \n\nIn early 2023, one botnet conducted a complex DDoS attack that was able to issue between 50 and 70 million requests per second originating from different cloud providers, [according to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/). VMs in the cloud can be both targets of DDoS attacks, as well as unwitting participants if a compromise goes undetected. \n\n### 3. Misconfigurations and Human Errors: \n\nSimple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic data breaches and with many companies facing a complex and sprawling cloud infrastructure it’s easy to make mistakes. Human error, whether accidental or due to lack of understanding of cloud configurations, is a consistent challenge. \n\nLet’s look at a common cloud misconfiguration example: your S3 bucket, which contains sensitive data about your customers, is publicly accessible. It sounds obvious, but a simple setting - making the bucket private - can prevent someone from the Internet accessing the data. However, if you are not aware of that configuration, this simple oversight might become a significant problem for your company; this is why it is very important to continuously monitor for misconfigurations and ensure you fix any findings in a timely manner. \n\n### 4. Insider Threats and Unauthorized Access: \n\nFrom disgruntled employees to compromised credentials, insider threats pose a unique and often overlooked challenge. Rigorous access control and monitoring are essential.  \n\nMoreover, a robust offboarding process for users is important to ensure that former employees no longer have access to the company’s assets after they have left the organization. Although the process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious, there should be a well-defined set of steps to check access rights when an employee leaves the company. After all, a favorite exercise of compliance auditors is to check a list of recently departed employees against current permissions and entitlements.  \n\n### 5. Cloud Service Providers and Shared Responsibility Model: \n\nUnderstanding the shared responsibility model with cloud service providers (CSPs) like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is vital. The delineation of responsibilities can sometimes be blurred, leading to security gaps.  \n\nFor example, if a user thinks that the cloud provider secures a virtual machine, they might neglect:  \n\n* closing management ports such as RDP (3389) and SSH (22), \n* using network security tools (such as firewalls, access control lists, network security groups), \n* managing VM disk encryption. \n\nThis might leave the VM unprotected because of the expectation that security is ‘somebody else’s problem’. \n\n### 6. Data Breaches and Loss: \n\nProtecting sensitive data is at the heart of cloud security. Data breaches and loss due to cyberattacks, human error, or even natural disasters can have devastating effects on organizations. Having PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stolen or leaked can lead to very grave consequences for a company. \n\nIn January 2023, the American wireless network provider T-Mobile revealed that a data breach that [potentially affected 37 million accounts occurred](https://www.reuters.com/technology/t-mobile-says-investigating-data-breach-affecting-37-mln-accounts-2023-01-19/) during 2022. Names, billing addresses, emails and phone numbers were some of the data that was leaked through an API with no authorization. Immediately in the wake of the news, T-Mobile stock fell 1%, and the company is currently under investigation by the FCC which could lead to further penalties.  \n\n### 7. Non-Compliance and Legal Risks: \n\nAdhering to regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA in the cloud can be complex. Non-compliance carries both legal risks and potential damage to reputation, especially for organizations in regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare. Compliance with international standards and laws ensures that: \n\n* Your company follows current cybersecurity best practices, \n* The reputation of your company is well maintained due to the continuous efforts to remain compliant. \n\nTo understand how serious non-compliance penalties can be, HIPAA is a good example. The maximum financial penalty for a HIPAA financial is almost $2 million, while criminal penalties can put the wrong-doer in jail for up to 10 years. It’s worth noting that regulation is also trending in the direction of at fault executives being held personally accountable, including jail time, to ensure that infringements can’t be offset by profits.  \n\nOne of the worst HIPAA violation cases happened in 2008 in one of the UCLA Health System hospitals. Employees accessed celebrity patients' medical records without authorization. A settlement of $865,000 was paid by the hospital, and the employees faced disciplinary actions. In general, employee discipline only goes as far as termination of employment but in some cases, employees have done time behind bars. \n\n### 8. Security Controls and Configurations: \n\nA security control in the cloud is a measure implemented based on a recommendation, a best practice or a requirement, designed to ensure that security and compliance of cloud resources and configurations are achieved.  \n\nImplementing and managing the right security controls and configurations is critical and tools like a Cloud Security Posture Management ([CSPM) platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) can be instrumental in managing these aspects effectively. Some tools, like Cyscale, go even further and visibility is greatly improved by bringing all of the security controls into one place, compared to multiple lists and dashboards of controls for each cloud provider, which can make it particularly challenging to see the big picture in the case of multi-cloud infrastructures. \n\n### 9. Endpoint Security and Real-time Protections: \n\nEndpoints are any device connected to a network. Examples of devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, point of sale terminals, and others. \n\nWith the rise of IoT and mobile workforces, securing endpoints and implementing real-time protections is more important than ever and more challenging given that these endpoints are often in the possession of individuals or at not easily accessible locations. A compromised or stolen laptop belonging to a senior engineer might be a good example here.  \n\nReal-time protection allows for threat detection and rapid response to attacks as they happen, as well as data loss prevention. For example, if you detect that a suspicious identity has connected to one of your VMs in the cloud, you can quickly act and cut off that identity before it can pivot to other cloud resources in your infrastructure. \n\n### 10. Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud Environments: \n\nManaging security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduces complexity.  \n\nMulti-cloud setups demand the appropriate handling of various security controls specific to each cloud provider and maintaining visibility across them, while hybrid models require seamless integration and consistent policies between on-premises and public cloud assets. In both cases, the complexity of the infrastructure and policies increases, making it crucial to stay on top of your security posture. \n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the cloud environment, robust strategies, and leveraging solutions like [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nThe good news? These challenges aren't insurmountable. In the sections that follow, we'll explore best practices to fortify your cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Section 2: Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment. Whether you're a CISO, a Cloud Security Expert, or a Senior System Administrator, this roadmap is tailored to meet the unique requirements of your organization's cloud security posture. \n\n### 1.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in cloud security and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).

The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.

It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers: \n\n* Real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, \n* A comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, \n* An overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, \n* Remediation solutions for findings, and many others. \n\nA CSPM is a solution that modern security teams use to proactively identify and fix security issues in their cloud infrastructure to ensure a strong security posture in the cloud. \n\n## A day in the life with CSPM \n\nWhat does a day in the life of a cloud security professional using a CSPM look like? First of all, we must see what it was like *before adopting a CSPM tool*. \n\nFrom manual security checks that take hours, to identifying and fixing compliance gaps, professionals may experience pressure in trying to secure the entire cloud environment. \n\nWith a CSPM, a cloud security team member can be more efficient. They may follow this workflow: \n\n1. The day starts by looking at open alerts and prioritizing the most important and impactful fixes. Using the remediation guidelines provided by the CSPM solution, they would solve some of the issues; \n2. The next step would be researching and understanding how to solve more complex problems identified by the CSPM: by looking at diagrams and dashboards, the user would gain enhanced visibility on how cloud resources are configured and relate to one another; \n3. If the company is going through an audit for a standard, such as ISO 27001 or PCI-DSS, they would assist their compliance colleagues with proper reporting and fixing any existing gaps; a low compliance score highlighted by the CSPM would indicate on which specific area they and the compliance team should focus on to improve the score. \n\nNow, using a comprehensive CSPM solution, confidence and control are gained. Notice how the cloud security professional is no longer spending time on security checks, but rather on actions that have an impact over the company’s cloud security posture. \n\nA CSPM tool has the following capabilities: \n\n### 1. Misconfigurations checks automation \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nOne common way in which scans are performed is controls. Security controls are based on recommendations and best practices; through them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nSome examples of common misconfigurations a CSPM looks for are: \n\n* An S3 bucket that should not be publicly accessible is, and anyone has READ or WRITE permissions on it, \n* The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port for a VM is open and can be accessed from the Internet, \n* Logging is disabled for cloud resources, thus unauthorized access cannot be detected. \n\nControls are among the most significant features you can find in a CSPM solution. Controls are based on security recommendations and best practices; using them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: from databases to buckets, from security groups to web applications, they cover a wide range of configurations and the result of using them surpasses any manual work that could be done. \n\n### 2. A robust alert system  \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nA good alert system can make a difference by reducing or eliminating false positives, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, and enabling understanding by adding context to findings. In this way, detected security issues are solved quickly, and *[alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/)* is avoided.  \n\nMoreover, a CSPM solution has integration with notification channels and ticketing systems to notify its users of findings. This feature is very useful for security teams because it streamlines the process and allows them to view urgent problems directly in the apps they use, such as Slack or Jira. \n\n### 3. Contextual visibility \n\nWithout proper visibility, a cloud security professional that intends to apply security best practices might do so in places with low impact, while higher risk items remain unaddressed. \n\nFor example, a company may have a VM running an application with a Log4Shell vulnerability, and multiple Internet-facing cloud resources that have less critical vulnerabilities. The VM may be prioritized because this type of vulnerability is severe and well-known. However, if that VM runs on a private network and is not accessible from the Internet, then the prioritization is not ideal, and Internet-facing applications and devices are neglected. \n\n### 4. Remediation steps \n\nA good CSPM solution aids security teams in their process of securing a cloud environment. \n\nDetailed remediation steps do not miss from CSPM software. Recommendations on how to fix findings include: \n\n* A series of actions a cloud security professional must execute in order to solve the identified problem, \n* A set of commands that fix the found issue, that can be used in a command line, \n* Recommended reading materials that could help the cloud security professional understand the problem on a deeper level and avoid it in the future. \n\n### 5. Compliance aid \n\nA company that seeks to achieve compliance with a certain standard or regulation must face a long and tedious journey, because this usually entails reviewing organizational, as well as technology-related practices, producing a lot of documentation in the form of policies and procedures, and ultimately ensuring that any system that comes in contact with customer data has appropriate security controls in place.  \n\nA CSPM tool eases this process by measuring the cloud security posture against the required state and providing compliance scoring. Moreover, after passing an audit, CSPMs can help companies stay compliant and ensure they’re following all security recommendations. \n\n### 6. Multi-cloud coverage \n\nWith CSPMs, you don’t need to monitor your infrastructure in a different place for each cloud service provider you’re using; CSPM tools are *[multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/)*! By covering Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, your entire technology stack in the cloud is secured by CSPMs. You can monitor and secure all of your cloud environments in one single platform. Moreover, you can define security policies in your CSPM tool and apply them across all cloud infrastructures. \n\nIn addition to analyzing security for cloud providers, some CSPMs offer additional types of integrations, such as those with identity providers. \n\nBy taking a proactive stance on cloud security posture, IT professionals can benefit from the power of a CSPM solution and ensure that their organization’s cloud infrastructure is resilient against emerging threats. \n\n### CSPM in Action - Real Life Case Studies \n\nCyscale is a [CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using powerful dashboards and security controls, saving teams considerable time on remediation. Cyscale also supports companies in their journey to compliance. \n\nTo see real-life examples of how a powerful CSPM tool works, you can read our case studies and learn *[how we’ve helped a company gain IAM visibility and ensure cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech/)*, or *[how we’ve identified blind spots in the infrastructure of another one of our customers, increasing their productivity by 50%.](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/)* \n\nBy implementing a robust CSPM solution, the companies gained comprehensive visibility into their cloud infrastructure, identified compliance gaps, and remediated them accordingly. Their security team was equipped with actionable insights, enabling them to quickly identify and address issues, preventing potential security incidents.  \n\nWith Cyscale, the companies achieved greater control and confidence in their cloud security posture, safeguarding sensitive customer data and maintaining regulatory compliance.  \n\n### The Future of Cloud Security Posture Management \n\nThe future of CSPM holds immense promise, driven by emerging technologies and an evolving security landscape. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, CSPM will play a pivotal role in ensuring secure cloud deployments.  \n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are already making their mark in CSPM, enabling intelligent automation and anomaly detection. These advancements will empower organizations to stay ahead of threats by identifying and remediating risks in real time, reducing manual effort, and enhancing the overall efficiency of cloud security operations. \n\nThe next step after CSPM is *[CNAPP: Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/)*. A CNAPP is a solution that incorporates multiple modules, among which is CSPM. Beside CSPM, you also find CIEM, Container Security, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and other components. \n\nWith this in mind, you can either use CSPM as a standalone solution, or integrate CNAPP with your cloud environment for more coverage in different areas in cloud security.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security.\n\nUpgrade your [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), a powerful tool offering comprehensive cloud inventory, advanced risk detection, multi-cloud support, and streamlined compliance processes to strengthen your business's cloud security posture."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor Google Cloud: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1.

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* A microservices architecture, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments across multiple cloud providers and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud apps, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM (virtual machine) if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan for application development. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system for your cloud-native applications. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nIf you have a robust security posture, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of native apps and shift their attention to important aspects. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale cloud platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple public cloud service providers such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time, even if you’re using multi-cloud workloads.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product","CSPM"],"title":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","seoTitle":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","description":"Alert fatigue is a phenomenon in which individuals receive an overwhelming amount of alerts and become desensitized to them.

Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.webp\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":5,"currentPage":1,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["CSPM","News","Product","Compliance","CNAPP","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
