The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.

It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers: \n\n* Real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, \n* A comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, \n* An overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, \n* Remediation solutions for findings, and many others. \n\nA CSPM is a solution that modern security teams use to proactively identify and fix security issues in their cloud infrastructure to ensure a strong security posture in the cloud. \n\n## A day in the life with CSPM \n\nWhat does a day in the life of a cloud security professional using a CSPM look like? First of all, we must see what it was like *before adopting a CSPM tool*. \n\nFrom manual security checks that take hours, to identifying and fixing compliance gaps, professionals may experience pressure in trying to secure the entire cloud environment. \n\nWith a CSPM, a cloud security team member can be more efficient. They may follow this workflow: \n\n1. The day starts by looking at open alerts and prioritizing the most important and impactful fixes. Using the remediation guidelines provided by the CSPM solution, they would solve some of the issues; \n2. The next step would be researching and understanding how to solve more complex problems identified by the CSPM: by looking at diagrams and dashboards, the user would gain enhanced visibility on how cloud resources are configured and relate to one another; \n3. If the company is going through an audit for a standard, such as ISO 27001 or PCI-DSS, they would assist their compliance colleagues with proper reporting and fixing any existing gaps; a low compliance score highlighted by the CSPM would indicate on which specific area they and the compliance team should focus on to improve the score. \n\nNow, using a comprehensive CSPM solution, confidence and control are gained. Notice how the cloud security professional is no longer spending time on security checks, but rather on actions that have an impact over the company’s cloud security posture. \n\nA CSPM tool has the following capabilities: \n\n### 1. Misconfigurations checks automation \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nOne common way in which scans are performed is controls. Security controls are based on recommendations and best practices; through them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  \n\nSome examples of common misconfigurations a CSPM looks for are: \n\n* An S3 bucket that should not be publicly accessible is, and anyone has READ or WRITE permissions on it, \n* The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port for a VM is open and can be accessed from the Internet, \n* Logging is disabled for cloud resources, thus unauthorized access cannot be detected. \n\nControls are among the most significant features you can find in a CSPM solution. Controls are based on security recommendations and best practices; using them, a CSPM tool automatically checks the cloud infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations: from databases to buckets, from security groups to web applications, they cover a wide range of configurations and the result of using them surpasses any manual work that could be done. \n\n### 2. A robust alert system  \n\nA CSPM performs scans at repeated time intervals, automating cloud configuration checks and triggering alerts for findings. \n\nA good alert system can make a difference by reducing or eliminating false positives, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities, and enabling understanding by adding context to findings. In this way, detected security issues are solved quickly, and *[alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/)* is avoided.  \n\nMoreover, a CSPM solution has integration with notification channels and ticketing systems to notify its users of findings. This feature is very useful for security teams because it streamlines the process and allows them to view urgent problems directly in the apps they use, such as Slack or Jira. \n\n### 3. Contextual visibility \n\nWithout proper visibility, a cloud security professional that intends to apply security best practices might do so in places with low impact, while higher risk items remain unaddressed. \n\nFor example, a company may have a VM running an application with a Log4Shell vulnerability, and multiple Internet-facing cloud resources that have less critical vulnerabilities. The VM may be prioritized because this type of vulnerability is severe and well-known. However, if that VM runs on a private network and is not accessible from the Internet, then the prioritization is not ideal, and Internet-facing applications and devices are neglected. \n\n### 4. Remediation steps \n\nA good CSPM solution aids security teams in their process of securing a cloud environment. \n\nDetailed remediation steps do not miss from CSPM software. Recommendations on how to fix findings include: \n\n* A series of actions a cloud security professional must execute in order to solve the identified problem, \n* A set of commands that fix the found issue, that can be used in a command line, \n* Recommended reading materials that could help the cloud security professional understand the problem on a deeper level and avoid it in the future. \n\n### 5. Compliance aid \n\nA company that seeks to achieve compliance with a certain standard or regulation must face a long and tedious journey, because this usually entails reviewing organizational, as well as technology-related practices, producing a lot of documentation in the form of policies and procedures, and ultimately ensuring that any system that comes in contact with customer data has appropriate security controls in place.  \n\nA CSPM tool eases this process by measuring the cloud security posture against the required state and providing compliance scoring. Moreover, after passing an audit, CSPMs can help companies stay compliant and ensure they’re following all security recommendations. \n\n### 6. Multi-cloud coverage \n\nWith CSPMs, you don’t need to monitor your infrastructure in a different place for each cloud service provider you’re using; CSPM tools are *[multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/)*! By covering Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, your entire technology stack in the cloud is secured by CSPMs. You can monitor and secure all of your cloud environments in one single platform. Moreover, you can define security policies in your CSPM tool and apply them across all cloud infrastructures. \n\nIn addition to analyzing security for cloud providers, some CSPMs offer additional types of integrations, such as those with identity providers. \n\nBy taking a proactive stance on cloud security posture, IT professionals can benefit from the power of a CSPM solution and ensure that their organization’s cloud infrastructure is resilient against emerging threats. \n\n### CSPM in Action - Real Life Case Studies \n\nCyscale is a [CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using powerful dashboards and security controls, saving teams considerable time on remediation. Cyscale also supports companies in their journey to compliance. \n\nTo see real-life examples of how a powerful CSPM tool works, you can read our case studies and learn *[how we’ve helped a company gain IAM visibility and ensure cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/smart-fintech)*, or *[how we’ve identified blind spots in the infrastructure of another one of our customers, increasing their productivity by 50%.](https://cyscale.com/case-studies/bays-consulting/)* \n\nBy implementing a robust CSPM solution, the companies gained comprehensive visibility into their cloud infrastructure, identified compliance gaps, and remediated them accordingly. Their security team was equipped with actionable insights, enabling them to quickly identify and address issues, preventing potential security incidents.  \n\nWith Cyscale, the companies achieved greater control and confidence in their cloud security posture, safeguarding sensitive customer data and maintaining regulatory compliance.  \n\n### The Future of Cloud Security Posture Management \n\nThe future of CSPM holds immense promise, driven by emerging technologies and an evolving security landscape. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, CSPM will play a pivotal role in ensuring secure cloud deployments.  \n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are already making their mark in CSPM, enabling intelligent automation and anomaly detection. These advancements will empower organizations to stay ahead of threats by identifying and remediating risks in real time, reducing manual effort, and enhancing the overall efficiency of cloud security operations. \n\nThe next step after CSPM is *[CNAPP: Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/)*. A CNAPP is a solution that incorporates multiple modules, among which is CSPM. Beside CSPM, you also find CIEM, Container Security, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and other components. \n\nWith this in mind, you can either use CSPM as a standalone solution, or integrate CNAPP with your cloud environment for more coverage in different areas in cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security.\n\n\n\nUpgrade your cloud security strategy with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), a powerful tool offering comprehensive cloud inventory, advanced risk detection, multi-cloud support, and streamlined compliance processes to strengthen your business's cloud security posture.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor Google Cloud: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* A microservices architecture, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments across multiple cloud providers and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud apps, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM (virtual machine) if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan for application development. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system for your cloud-native applications. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nIf you have a robust security posture, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of native apps and shift their attention to important aspects. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale cloud platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple public cloud service providers such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time, even if you’re using multi-cloud workloads.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product","CSPM"],"title":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","seoTitle":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","description":"Alert fatigue is a phenomenon in which individuals receive an overwhelming amount of alerts and become desensitized to them.

Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.webp\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","Compliance"],"title":"Cloud Security and Compliance: A Guide for Your Cloud Infrastructure","seoTitle":"Cloud Security and Compliance: A Guide for Your Cloud Infrastructure","description":"Cloud security and compliance go hand-in-hand.

Following cybersecurity best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its cloud computing environments.\n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments and prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.webp\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege for access control, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all cloud data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks and data breaches.. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 security controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies regulatory compliance requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. healthcare federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous regulatory requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation.\n\nTo read more about these compliance standards, as well as NIST, check out our [whitepaper](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/the-complete-guide-to-cloud-compliance/). \n\nOur [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/)  can help you secure your cloud environment and become compliant with respected accreditations through: \n\n* Over 400 controls, across multiple public cloud service providers, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Google Cloud, that help you stay on top of your security program, \n* Both pre-configured and editable security policies that can be associated to controls, \n* Powerful identity and security dashboards for enhanced visibility over your cloud infrastructure, and others. \n\nSecure your cloud infrastructure effectively with expert insights on cloud security and compliance best practices and international standards.

This version is bringing considerable changes to the old [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/). Let's examine them and understand what they might mean to your company.  \n\n## The Changes \n\n### 1. The structure of the standard has changed. \n\nInstead of 14 clauses in Annex A that categorized the controls, ISO 27001:2022 groups all controls into four themes: \n\n* People (8 controls), \n* Organizational (37 controls), \n* Technological (34 controls),  \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\n### 2. Some controls have been merged or renamed. \n\nISO 27001:2022 contains 93 controls, instead of 114. Let’s look at examples of controls that have been modified: \n\n1. **A.18.1.1** Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements, and \n2. **A.18.1.5** Regulation of cryptographic controls. \n\nHave been merged into: \n\n1. **A.5.31** Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements. \n\nA control that remained the same but has been moved to a different section is: \n\n> **A.18.1.2 Intellectual property rights.**  \n\nIt has been modified to: \n\n> **A.5.32 Intellectual property rights.** \n\n### 3. New controls have been added \n\nBelow, you can see the list of the 11 new controls added to Annex A of the ISO 27001:2022 standard. \n\n1. Threat intelligence (A.5.7) \n2. Information security for the use of cloud services (A.5.23) \n3. ICT readiness for business continuity (A.5.30) \n4. Physical security monitoring (A.7.4) \n5. Configuration management (A.8.9) \n6. Information deletion (A.8.10) \n7. Data masking (A.8.11) \n8. Data leakage prevention (A.8.12) \n9. Monitoring activities (A.8.16) \n10. Web filtering (A.8.23) \n11. Secure coding (A.8.28) \n\nA notable control is 5.23, “Information security for the use of cloud services”, since now, cloud security has a dedicated control. This preventative control is designed to keep risk at a minimum and regulate the management and usage of cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This control covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \n\n### 4. Controls have attributes \n\nAccording to [IT Governance](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001-and-iso27002-2022-updates), controls can now be categorized based on 5 different attributes, with the mentioned values: \n\n* **Control type** (preventive, detective, corrective) \n* **Information security properties** (confidentiality, integrity, availability) \n* **Cybersecurity concepts** (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover) \n* **Operational capabilities** (governance, asset management, etc.) \n* **Security domains** (governance and ecosystem, protection, defense, resilience) \n\nUsing these attributes, your company can organize the controls based on their scope. \n\n## What does this mean to a CISO? \n\nThe [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) certification has a three-year validity, and the old version of the standard will be valid until it expires. Therefore, companies have a three-year period to recertify and become compliant with the new version of ISO 27001. This means that, at the latest, companies must recertify before the 31st of October 2025.  \n\nThe process of obtaining the [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/) certification is time-consuming and difficult. However, you can make this task easier with Cyscale. \n\nCyscale helps you become compliant with international standards by providing hundreds of controls that help you secure your cloud environment, ensure you have implemented the requirements for international standards, and also aid you when going through audits. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":4,"currentPage":1,"category":"CSPM","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CSPM","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CSPM","categoriesList":["CSPM","News","Compliance","CNAPP","Product","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","632500807"]}
