And, because of that, \n\n* understanding how cloud assets are interconnected, \n* establishing correct policies, \n* regulating access control \n\nare all tasks that should be carefully approached when thinking about your company’s cloud. \n\nTherefore, it is necessary to take some steps to make sure your company’s cloud is secure. \n\nIn order to minimize risks and secure your cloud environment, you need to manage your cloud security posture.  \n\nIn this article, you will see how to improve it and provide a safe environment for your assets. \n\nHere are some key actions that you need to take to make sure that your cloud is secure. \n\n1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets \n2. Detect misconfigurations  \n3. Implement remediation for findings \n4. Ensure logging and monitoring \n5. Assure compliance with security standards \n\nLet us talk more about these tasks and how to accomplish them. \n\n<br/>\n\n**1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets** \n\nLooking at many configurations at once may become overwhelming very fast. \n\nIt is hard to notice flaws in your security design if discovery and visibility are not assured. \n\nDiscovery and visibility in cloud imply being able to visualize cloud assets in an organized and easily readable way, for example in a dashboard.  \n\nEven more useful is when visibility for each asset is enriched by additional context that may be provided in a graph view.\n\n![A graph from the Cyscale application.](/img/graph_image.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nLooking at: \n\n* policies, \n* configurations, \n* connections between assets \n\nin a centralized fashion can help in pointing out: \n\n1. unnecessarily permissive rights \n2. vulnerabilities in your cloud configuration.  \n3. odd changes in your infrastructure. \n\nIt is critical to make sure that visibility is satisfied, in order to enable threat discovery. \n\nFor example, [a graph that maps networks of cloud assets. identities and workloads](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) can help you properly understand relationships, properties, and types of assets in your cloud environment. \n\nVisually examining the characteristics of your infrastructure may aid you in taking the right measures to improve security. \n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Detect misconfigurations** \n\nAccording to [Continuity Central](https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/7117-misconfiguration-was-the-number-one-cause-of-cloud-security-incidents-in-2021), misconfigurations in the cloud environment were the main cause of cloud security breaches in 2021. It is easy to overlook: \n\n* a badly configured access list (ACL) \n* a bad policy for access control \n* an open port that should not be there, and others. \n\nHumans make mistakes. Even a minor misconfiguration that does not impact the activity in your cloud may lead to catastrophic events such as: \n\n* public access to your containers, \n* malware intrusion, \n* lateral movement.  \n\nDiscovering these mistakes before they are exploited is critical.  \n\nIdeally, you should have an automated way to check for common cloud misconfigurations. \n\nWe will provide you with a solution later in this article to easily keep misconfigurations under control and be notified when new ones appear. \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Implement remediation for findings** \n\nIt is not enough to only discover threats in your design. \n\nYou need to also be able to remediate the flaws in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nKnowing how to properly fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is a key factor in improving your cloud security. \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are: \n\n* restricting overly permissive access to users, \n* closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* blocking inbound & outbound traffic. \n\n<br/>\n\n**4. Ensure logging and monitoring** \n\nIt is very important to catch threats before they become incidents.  \n\nA good measure to take is keeping logs and documenting every event that occurs. \n\nIn this case, **targeted alerts** can save your company from disaster by pinpointing: \n\n* misconfigurations \n* suspicious activity \n* attacks coming from outside.  \n\nSpotting threats immediately or within a short period of time may save your cloud environment from being breached. \n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Assure compliance with international standards** \n\nMaking sure that your company is compliant with international standards such as [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/) not only consolidates your data protection services but also shows your clients that you acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity. \n\nFollowing [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) recommended by standards can greatly improve your cloud security posture. \n\nHowever, fulfilling all of the requirements consistently to become compliant with an international standard is a very tedious and time-consuming job. \n\nA solution to this would be automating controls and compliance checks that scan your platform for every requirement and show if you are fulfilling every request. \n\n<br/>\n\nWe have reached the end of the article and now you are probably wondering: \n\n**How do you implement all of the mentioned steps?** \n\nThe tasks described above can be implemented using a [CSPM product (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nCSPM is a component of cloud security that analyzes your cloud environment and alerts you on what controls are failing in your infrastructure. \n\nYour cloud security posture would be improved significantly and promptly when using a CSPM.  \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions to all of the problems raised in this article. \n\nWith Cyscale, you can: \n\n* get an overview of your assets and configurations, \n* easily manage misconfigurations, \n* receive targeted and precise alerts, \n* remediate accidents and flaws in your cloud environment faster, \n* become compliant with international standards. \n\nStart automating tasks, make these processes easier for you and generate reliable results, with [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","description":"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Technology Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines is a set of principles and best practices destined for financial institutions, meant to regulate risk management and assessment, access control, incident management, software application development, and others.

Technology Risk Governance and Oversight \n2. Technology Risk Management Framework \n3. IT Project Management and Security-by-Design \n4. Software Application Development and Management \n5. IT Service Management \n6. IT Resilience \n7. Access Control \n8. Cryptography \n9. Data and Infrastructure Security \n10. Cyber Security Operations \n11. Cyber Security Assessment \n12. Online Financial Services \n13. IT Audit \n\nThese sections contain subsections that describe in detail the best practices that should be followed for each area covered by that section.  \n\nIt is important to note that MAS TRM Guidelines does not contain any specific controls, and it is up to the organization to create and tailor controls to fulfill each section's recommendations. \n\nIn this article, we will look in detail at the sections that may apply for cloud environments and understand the requirements. \n\n## IT Resilience  \n\nThis section describes the importance of: \n\n* Availability,  \n* Recoverability, \n* Disaster recovery, \n* Backups,  \n* Data centre resilience. \n\n**Availability** ensures users can access data without interruption. High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 276 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","seoTitle":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","description":"Along with the new year come new resolutions.

Still, companies outside this range also choose to become NIST compliant due to the excellent reputation and benefits of the standard. \n\nThree NIST frameworks can be used when establishing NIST compliance: \n\n* NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* NIST 800-53, \n* NIST 800-171. \n\nLet’s look at them in detail to understand the differences. \n\n## NIST Cybersecurity Framework \n\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) gathers best practices and standards to help companies build a robust cybersecurity program and manage risk.  \n\nThe framework contains 5 core functions, which contain 23 categories, which in turn are divided into 108 subcategories formulated as outcomes. Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing which framework is suitable for you and becoming compliant is not an easy task.  \n\nCyscale can help you ease the process of becoming NIST compliant. Using our Standards page, you can track your progress and speed up the process in terms of your cloud-specific needs. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-standards.png\" alt=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" title=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","seoTitle":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","description":"We have released a new, powerful Data Security Dashboard to provide visibility in the cloud.

The Dashboard displays information about: \n\n* Encryption, \n* The management of cryptographic keys, \n* Publicly accessible storage assets such as VMs, databases, [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/), and others, \n* Databases and misconfigurations related to them, \n* Containers such as blobs and buckets that may vulnerable, and others. \n\nThese DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities enable users to detect attack paths for data storage assets and quickly mitigate them.  \n\nThe first section of the dashboard shows us the percentage of storage assets that are:  \n\n* unencrypted,  \n* encrypted with provider-managed-key, and  \n* encrypted with CMK (Customer Managed Key).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-progress-card.png\" alt=\"Progress card for encryption status\" title=\"Progress card for encryption status\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nThis card is a good indicator of progress, and, by clicking on each section of the status bar, we see which assets fit in each of those states. Using this feature, you are at a click away from finding out which of your storage cloud assets are unencrypted. \n\nThe next section contains the Publicly Accessible card, which provides visibility over a multitude of assets, as you can see in the image below. When you click on each element, you see a list of affected assets, along with the associated risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-second-image.png\" alt=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" title=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at this feature in more detail to understand how this helps secure your cloud infrastructure. \n\nThe “**Readable Object Containers**” and “**Writable Object Containers**” refer to storage assets such as [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) and blobs. Object containers should not be publicly accessible unless it is necessary, since individuals could then read or overwrite possibly sensitive data without having to perform any kind of authentication or authorization. \n\nThe next item in this section highlights **database instances that have public IP addresses**. Databases should be configured with private IP addresses to reduce attack surface and increase security. \n\nThe last items in this list are publicly accessible: \n\n* **queues**,  \n* **encryption keys**, and  \n* **disks**.  \n\n[Cloud queues](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-queues-security-best-practices/) act like buffers to prevent data loss when services are too busy and cannot process incoming messages, and therefore should not be publicly accessible to prevent data leakage or data tampering. The control regarding encryption keys checks for attached policies that may allow public access to the key. The other control ensures there are no disks attached to VMs reachable from the internet. \n\nThe next card on the Data Security Dashboard provides an overview of the [encryption keys](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) used in your cloud infrastructure. Cryptographic key management is a very important but sometimes overlooked aspect of the encryption process.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-encryption-keys.png\" alt=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" title=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nCyscale checks if the encryption keys are stored on a vulnerable VM or if they have a permissive access policy to identify possible attack paths. Moreover, important information is highlighted, such as: \n\n* keys that are in use and are scheduled for deletion, \n* keys that haven’t been rotated in a long time, and \n* keys that will expire soon. \n\nThe next two sections in this dashboard focus on object containers, such as buckets or blobs, and on [databases](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/). Here, you can see some of the categories of vulnerabilities Cyscale has identified and checked your cloud environment against.  \n\nThe first card presents the state of your object containers. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-publicly-accessible-assets.png\" alt=\"Object containers with issues\" title=\"Object containers with issues\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUsing this feature, we identify attack paths that may compromise your cloud assets and help you solve them. \n\nFor example, a common attack is exploiting VMs that have open management ports. If you have a VM that has permissions on a bucket, and that VM is compromised, your bucket may be compromised as well.  \n\nUsing the [Cyscale Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/), you can see that the VM named \"sql-instance\" has an instance profile that gives it full access to the bucket on the far right, and the VM also has port 22 (SSH) open. The VM is thus connected to the internet and therefore puts the data stored in the bucket at risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-14-min.png\" alt=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph highlighting an attack path\" title=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nOther critical issues highlighted for object containers include: \n\n* Enabling public access to storage assets, \n* Having an overly-permissive access policy,  \n* Not enabling versioning, and others. \n\nClicking on “Object containers with public access”, we get a list of misconfigured assets as well as details like: \n\n* Connectors, which represents the cloud or identity provider account, \n* Tags,  \n* Risks. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_32-second-to-last.png\" alt=\"List of misconfigured assets\" title=\"List of misconfigured assets\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nMoving on to the databases card, using controls, Cyscale checks for the following misconfigurations: \n\n* **Databases with public IP addresses,** \n* **Databases with outdated engine versions,** \n* **Databases without deletion protection,** \n* **Databases with no encryption,** \n* **Databases with no/old TLS.** \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_32-databases-last.png\" alt=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" title=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUse the multitude of features present in the Cyscale Data Security Dashboard to eliminate data exposure through [data storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/).
