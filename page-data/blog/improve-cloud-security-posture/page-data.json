And, because of that, \n\n* understanding how cloud assets are interconnected, \n* establishing correct policies, \n* regulating access control \n\nare all tasks that should be carefully approached when thinking about your company’s cloud. \n\nTherefore, it is necessary to take some steps to make sure your company’s cloud is secure. \n\nIn order to minimize risks and secure your cloud environment, you need to manage your cloud security posture.  \n\nIn this article, you will see how to improve it and provide a safe environment for your assets. \n\nHere are some key actions that you need to take to make sure that your cloud is secure. \n\n1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets \n2. Detect misconfigurations  \n3. Implement remediation for findings \n4. Ensure logging and monitoring \n5. Assure compliance with security standards \n\nLet us talk more about these tasks and how to accomplish them. \n\n<br/>\n\n**1. Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets** \n\nLooking at many configurations at once may become overwhelming very fast. \n\nIt is hard to notice flaws in your security design if discovery and visibility are not assured. \n\nDiscovery and visibility in cloud imply being able to visualize cloud assets in an organized and easily readable way, for example in a dashboard.  \n\nEven more useful is when visibility for each asset is enriched by additional context that may be provided in a graph view.\n\n![A graph from the Cyscale application.](/img/graph_image.png#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nLooking at: \n\n* policies, \n* configurations, \n* connections between assets \n\nin a centralized fashion can help in pointing out: \n\n1. unnecessarily permissive rights \n2. vulnerabilities in your cloud configuration.  \n3. odd changes in your infrastructure. \n\nIt is critical to make sure that visibility is satisfied, in order to enable threat discovery. \n\nFor example, [a graph that maps networks of cloud assets. identities and workloads](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) can help you properly understand relationships, properties, and types of assets in your cloud environment. \n\nVisually examining the characteristics of your infrastructure may aid you in taking the right measures to improve security. \n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Detect misconfigurations** \n\nAccording to [Continuity Central](https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/7117-misconfiguration-was-the-number-one-cause-of-cloud-security-incidents-in-2021), misconfigurations in the cloud environment were the main cause of cloud security breaches in 2021. It is easy to overlook: \n\n* a badly configured access list (ACL) \n* a bad policy for access control \n* an open port that should not be there, and others. \n\nHumans make mistakes. Even a minor misconfiguration that does not impact the activity in your cloud may lead to catastrophic events such as: \n\n* public access to your containers, \n* malware intrusion, \n* lateral movement.  \n\nDiscovering these mistakes before they are exploited is critical.  \n\nIdeally, you should have an automated way to check for common cloud misconfigurations. \n\nWe will provide you with a solution later in this article to easily keep misconfigurations under control and be notified when new ones appear. \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Implement remediation for findings** \n\nIt is not enough to only discover threats in your design. \n\nYou need to also be able to remediate the flaws in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nKnowing how to properly fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is a key factor in improving your cloud security. \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are: \n\n* restricting overly permissive access to users, \n* closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* blocking inbound & outbound traffic. \n\n<br/>\n\n**4. Ensure logging and monitoring** \n\nIt is very important to catch threats before they become incidents.  \n\nA good measure to take is keeping logs and documenting every event that occurs. \n\nIn this case, **targeted alerts** can save your company from disaster by pinpointing: \n\n* misconfigurations \n* suspicious activity \n* attacks coming from outside.  \n\nSpotting threats immediately or within a short period of time may save your cloud environment from being breached. \n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Assure compliance with international standards** \n\nMaking sure that your company is compliant with international standards such as [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/) not only consolidates your data protection services but also shows your clients that you acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity. \n\nFollowing [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) recommended by standards can greatly improve your cloud security posture. \n\nHowever, fulfilling all of the requirements consistently to become compliant with an international standard is a very tedious and time-consuming job. \n\nA solution to this would be automating controls and compliance checks that scan your platform for every requirement and show if you are fulfilling every request. \n\n<br/>\n\nWe have reached the end of the article and now you are probably wondering: \n\n**How do you implement all of the mentioned steps?** \n\nThe tasks described above can be implemented using a [CSPM product (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nCSPM is a component of cloud security that analyzes your cloud environment and alerts you on what controls are failing in your infrastructure. \n\nYour cloud security posture would be improved significantly and promptly when using a CSPM.  \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions to all of the problems raised in this article. \n\nWith Cyscale, you can: \n\n* get an overview of your assets and configurations, \n* easily manage misconfigurations, \n* receive targeted and precise alerts, \n* remediate accidents and flaws in your cloud environment faster, \n* become compliant with international standards. \n\nStart automating tasks, make these processes easier for you and generate reliable results, with [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!
