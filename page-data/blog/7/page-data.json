If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","seoTitle":"What to Look for in a CSPM?","description":"A CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tool is a product that scans your cloud environment for vulnerabilities and alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure.

It alerts you if it finds any misconfigurations in the cloud infrastructure. \n\nThis article will discuss what you need to look for in a CSPM and help you make the right choice regarding your [cloud's security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n### Does it check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities? \n\nThere is a long list of possible misconfigurations, policy violations, and mistakes that can disrupt your cloud system. \n\nA good CSPM tool will have controls to check for a wide variety of vulnerabilities and correctly identify any misconfigurations. \n\nSome of [the most common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) are: \n\n* Poor storage access configuration, \n* Broken access control, \n* Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic, \n* Missing encryption, \n* Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\n### Does it have an integration with your preferred cloud platform? \n\nThe CSPM tool you choose must be compatible with the cloud platform your system is using. The top three vendors in the cloud industry are: \n\n* [Amazon Web Services Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) \n* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) \n* [Microsoft Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) \n\nWith Cyscale, you can scan and maintain your cloud security posture for all three of the vendors mentioned above, as well as Alibaba Cloud. \n\nAnother essential feature is that Cyscale integrates Okta identities. \n\n### What compliance frameworks does it support? \n\nA certificate of [compliance with a standard such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/) can be an asset because it advertises the following things about your company: \n\n* You understand the significance of cybersecurity, \n* Your organization is working to reduce the risk of information security breaches, \n* You are adequately managing information security. \n\nIn order to make the best use of your [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/), take into account what compliance standard or certification your company is going for. A few examples are: \n\n* ISO 27001 \n* SOC 2 \n* NIST 800-53 \n* PCI-DSS \n* CIS \n* GDPR \n\nSome standards require you to write your own policies such as Data Protection or Disaster Recovery.  \n\nYou can manage them using traditional tools such as Microsoft Word and Sharepoint, or you can use a powerful policy editor and gain inline evidence collection offered by Cyscale. \n\n### Is the CSPM providing vulnerability and risk scoring? \n\nPrioritization of issues and risk scoring is an essential feature of a CSPM. \n\nAssigning risk levels to assets and prioritizing remediation can significantly increase a company's security. \n\nVulnerability scoring is another essential feature that can help you avoid false positives and prioritize tasks. Time is crucial when discussing vulnerabilities, so quick actions need to be taken to prevent breaches. \n\nThis is why it is essential to ensure that false positives are avoided because they can cause noise that may distract employees from more important matters. \n\n![Alerts divided by severity](/img/alerts-severity.webp#shadow \"Risk scoring in Cyscale\")\n\n### Do you receive targeted alerts? \n\nReceiving thousands of alerts can be overwhelming. Your CSPM tool needs to filter them and send relevant, targeted alerts. \n\nCyscale currently has two types of notifications that can be customized to your preference: \n\n1. Security Posture. These weekly digests show you your cloud security posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count. You can see an example below. \n\n![A Security Posture email showing a posture trend and a high/medium/low-risk asset count](/img/security-posture.webp#shadow \"Security Posture Email from Cyscale\")\n\n2. Alerts. They are sent in batches for a given cloud account in a single email to ensure that they do not become overwhelming. These alerts inform you of new vulnerabilities found in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nBesides these personal notifications sent to your email, you can also enable alerts on Slack, Teams, or an app of your choice, by using Webhook. \n\n### Does it provide remediation for found vulnerabilities? \n\nFinding misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure is just the first step. \n\nApplying the correct remediation before it becomes a breach is critical to securing your cloud.  \n\nCyscale provides, along with the controls that pinpoint what vulnerability has been identified, the following: \n\n* an explanation of the cause of the control failure, \n* how the vulnerability was identified, \n* remediation steps. \n\nThe remediation steps can ensure you're applying the modifications correctly and speed up the process of securing your assets. \n\nMake the right decision for your company by using a robust CSPM that helps secure your cloud infrastructure and provides all of the features mentioned above and more. \n\nCyscale ensures the following features: \n\n* checks for a wide variety of vulnerabilities, \n* integration with AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba, Okta, \n* support for compliance frameworks and standards, \n* prioritization of assets remediation and alerts, \n* targeted and custom alerts, \n* remediation steps and vulnerabilities reports. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Okta Security Best Practices ","seoTitle":"Okta Security Best Practices ","description":"Okta is an identity and access management (IAM) service built for the cloud.

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee uses a weak password for their accounts. The password was cracked through a brute-force attack by an attacker. \n\nThe employee re-uses their password for Okta SSO, and MFA is not implemented in the company, so the attacker now has full access to all of the employee's accounts. \n\n### Best practice \n\n[MFA](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is a type of authentication that requires an entity to provide at least two different types of credentials. \n\nThey should be of the following:  \n\n* What you know (example: a PIN)  \n* What you have (example: a security token)  \n* What you are (example: a fingerprint)  \n\nOkta recommends you use a one-time password or a biometric verification in your authentication scheme in order to add an extra layer of security. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 2. Stop using passwords \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn employee writes their password on a post-it note and leaves it on their desk. \n\nAn employee from another department finds it and can now login into the employee's account. \n\n### Best practice \n\nPasswordless authentication is possible by providing a public identifier (such as a username or an email address) and then using a different way of proving your identity (through a phone or a token, for example), thus eliminating the use of passwords. \n\nThis type of authentication is secure because: \n\n* Weak passwords are no longer a concern for your company \n* Solutions for password storage are not an issue anymore \n* The credentials cannot be breached; therefore, you're reducing the number of points of failure \n\nOkta suggests solutions that can help you go passwordless. You can use: \n\n* Okta Fastpass, which allows you to authenticate passwordless from any device or location to any Okta-managed application; \n* WebAuthn, a standard that simplifies authentication. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 3. Manage user access by following the Least Privilege Principle \n\n### Scenario \n\nAlthough they do not require such privileges, an employee was assigned administrative rights. \n\nThe employee accidentally deletes an asset—this action results in permanent data loss. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that users should not have more permissions than they require to perform their tasks. \n\nUser access control management is a security best practice recommended by [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) that helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nFor example, a regular user should not have administrator rights unless they need them for daily tasks. \n\nMake sure to restrict users as much as possible in accordance with their jobs. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 4. Ensure the Separation of Duties \n\n### Scenario \n\nThe administrator goes on vacation. They are the only ones with administrator privileges.  \n\nA critical vulnerability appears in the cloud infrastructure, but nobody has the necessary rights to patch it. The administrator cannot be contacted and is out of the office for a few weeks. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe Separation of Duties Principle helps eliminate a single point of failure by assuring no entity has the rights to execute a critical task by themselves. \n\nConfiguring at least two administrators eliminates the single point of failure. It ensures that if one of them is missing, the other can still perform tasks requiring administrative privileges. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 5. Monitor activity \n\n### Scenario \n\nAn attacker manages to gain control of an employee's account and authenticates from a different device or an unusual location. \n\nThis authentication is logged, but the logs are not carefully monitored, so the breach goes undetected. \n\nThe hacker can now move laterally and compromise workstations, databases, and other accounts without raising any alarms in the company. \n\n### Best practice \n\nLogging and monitoring are two features that should be implemented in your cloud environment. \n\nThese technologies can help you identify suspicious behavior, such as: \n\n* **an impossible log-in**, for example when a user authenticates from two different parts of the world in a few minutes, \n* **a user connecting to an application from a different device than expected**, and others. \n\nOkta recommends that you constantly look for odd activity in your cloud infrastructure and make sure you take actions when you identify them, such as verifying a user's identity through MFA. \n\n<br/>\n\n#### 6. Automate onboarding and offboarding \n\n### Scenario \n\nA software developer leaves the company, but their account is not correctly deprovisioned.  \n\nThey can still contribute to GitHub repositories and modify production code. \n\n### Best practice \n\nThe process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious. \n\nThere should be a well-defined set of steps when an employee leaves the company. Automate as many of them as possible, to make sure that: \n\n* You correctly deprovision their account, and \n* They cannot access and make changes to your systems anymore. \n\nAlong with these Okta-centric recommendations, it's essential to ensure that your organization adheres to broader **[cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)**.

This example combines \"What you know\" with \"What you have\".  \n\nHere are some of the controls implemented in Cyscale that check if MFA is configured for your cloud environment: \n\n* *Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users that have a console password* for AWS \n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all privileged users* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users* for Microsoft Azure \n\nSSO (Single Sign-On) should also be integrated in the authentication scheme to grant access to individual users across multiple environments using just one set of credentials. \n\n</div>\n\n### Rotate credentials and keys regularly \n\nThis best practice is recommended across all vendors and should be implemented in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nThis method helps minimize the impact if a key or a set of credentials is breached. \n\nIn the case of user credentials, passwords should be changed with new, different ones. \n\nWhen rotating keys, the old ones should be retired, and new keys should be generated. \n\nWe suggest that you rotate your keys and credentials at least every 90 days. \n\nSome examples of validation controls offered by Cyscale that check if credentials or keys are rotated regularly are: \n\n* *Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less* for AWS (Amazon Web Services) \n* *Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days* for Google Cloud\n* *Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or less* for AWS \n\nMoreover, a strong password policy should be implemented to prevent individuals from using weak passwords. \n\n### Comply with The Principle of Least Privilege \n\nConforming to The Principle of Lease Privilege is another essential best practice instilled in cloud security and recommended by the vendors we've discussed.  \n\nIn order to comply with this concept, you need to restrict user access to the least privileged access and eliminate all administrator and root user accounts that are not strictly necessary.  \n\nAWS recommends that you start setting up your policies with a minimum of possible permissions and add more on the go, if necessary, to correctly manage access control.  \n\nMake sure you're not missing anything when implementing the concept of least privilege by using controls offered by Cyscale that detect misconfigurations, like the ones below: \n\n* *Ensure that ServiceAccount has no Admin privileges* for Google Cloud\n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS \n\n### Assign permissions at group level  \n\nAnother best practice we recommend to ensure IAM Cloud Security is managing specific permissions at group level and not at the user level. \n\nWhenever you're adding a new user or trying to manage multiple users, assign them to a group with very well-defined rules and privileges. \n\nHere are some controls from Cyscale that check if you're implementing this IAM security best practice: \n\n* *Ensure IAM Users receive permissions only through Groups* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure IAM Policies are attached only to groups or roles* for AWS Cloud \n\n### Implement logging and monitoring \n\nAWS, Google Cloud, and Azure recommend that you implement logging and monitoring for your cloud environment. All three vendors provide these features.  \n\nFor AWS IAM, you can use one of the following IAM services: \n\n* AWS CloudTrail \n* Amazon CloudFront \n* Amazon CloudWatch \n* AWS Config \n* Amazon S3 \n\nGoogle Cloud supplies Cloud Audit Logs, a service that audits your IAM policy, access to cloud service account keys, and other components of Google Cloud. \n\nFor Azure, you can use Azure AD activity logs which can be supplemented by Azure Monitor logs to alert you on significant events. \n\nExamples of controls across all three cloud providers can be seen below: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs* for AWS \n* *Ensure that Diagnostic Logs are enabled for all services which support it* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud Audit Logging is configured properly across all services and all users from a project* for Google Cloud\n\nIdentity and Access Management is a crucial component of the cloud and should be adequately secured to prevent data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents. Reduce the attack surface by eliminating any vulnerabilities in the authentication process and keeping hackers away.\n\nUse Cyscale to identify any [misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/) or gaps in your cloud infrastructure and secure it with our over 400 controls. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"IAM Services in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud - A Cloud Industry Overview","seoTitle":"IAM Services in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud - a Cloud Industry Overview","description":"An industry overview of the IAM Services.

Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![Google Cloud IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.webp#shadow \"Google Cloud IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n[In the following article](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), we will look at best practices described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Common Cloud Misconfigurations and How to Avoid Them","seoTitle":"Common Cloud Misconfigurations and How to Avoid Them","description":"Cloud misconfigurations are the number one reason for security breaches.

Poor storage access configuration \n2. Broken access control \n3. Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic \n4. Missing encryption \n5. Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring \n\nThis article will explain these misconfigurations and help you work them out.  \n\nWe will also give you some examples of the controls Cyscale implements to ensure foolproof configurations for your company’s cloud. \n\n<div id=\"storage-access\">\n\n## **1. Poor storage access configuration**\n\nStorage access misconfigurations usually make cloud assets open to the public view. \n\nWe can take as an example Amazon S3 buckets. A significant security vulnerability is making an S3 bucket that contains sensitive data public. This means that everyone on the internet can access your data. \n\nThere are two ways in which public access over a bucket can lead to cybersecurity incidents: \n\n* Public “READ” access \n* Public “WRITE” access \n\nPublic “READ” access over a company’s buckets creates the risk of a data breach.  \n\n“WRITE” access over a bucket is arguably worse – this means that entities from the internet can infiltrate malware such as \n\n* backdoors,\n* ransomware,\n\nor even crowd your bucket with their data in order to obtain free storage. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nBlock public access using access lists and policies.  \n\nAn access control list (ACL) is a set of rules that limit access to buckets through permissions. It defines the access level an account has over a bucket (for example, READ or WRITE). \n\nLet’s look at some examples of controls offered by Cyscale that check if you have storage access misconfigurations: \n\n* *Ensure that S3 Buckets are configured with 'Block public access (bucket settings)'* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure network access rule for storage bucket is not set to publicly accessible* for Alibaba Cloud\n\n</div>\n\n## **2. Broken access control**\n\nWhen talking about access control misconfigurations, we refer to overly permissive rights. \n\nThe Principle of Least Privilege states that a user should not be given more permissions than they need to perform their job. \n\nBadly implemented access control can lead to cybersecurity incidents because: \n\n* an employee may accidentally misconfigure other assets because they are given the right to, even though they shouldn’t have it, \n* an attacker that gets ahold of an employee’s account may leverage the broad range of permissions they have to further penetrate the infrastructure or gain access to secrets. \n\nAdministrator or root privileges should only be given to those users who absolutely require them. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nRestrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all administrator/root accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\nTwo examples of the many controls Cyscale has that regulate this issue are: \n\n* *Ensure that ServiceAccount has no Admin privileges* for Google Cloud Platform \n* *Eliminate use of the \"root\" user for administrative and daily tasks* for AWS Cloud \n\nAnother best practice to mention is having groups with very well-defined rules and privileges. \n\nIn this way, you can assign a user to the correct group and minimize the risk of making a mistake when adding permissions for a new user or when trying to manage multiple users. \n\nThe implementation of this feature is checked by Cyscale using, for example, the following controls: \n\n* *Ensure IAM Users receive permissions only through Groups* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure RAM policies are attached only to groups or roles* for Alibaba Cloud \n\n## **3. Unrestricted inbound and outbound traffic**\n\nWhen we talk about cloud networking, we have two types of traffic: \n\n1. Inbound\n2. Outbound\n\nEach one involves a different type of risk. \n\nWith inbound traffic, unnecessarily open ports may be a door inside for an attacker. \n\nOn the other hand, outbound unrestricted traffic allows a perpetrator to: \n\n* exfiltrate data \n* pivot to other assets in your cloud environment (otherwise known as lateral movement) \n* scan your infrastructure and gather data about your company \n\n### **Solution**\n\nMake sure to close or restrict ports that are not necessary. Use access lists to restrict ranges of IPs and ports. \n\nLet’s look at two of the hundreds of controls implemented in Cyscale that restrict unnecessary traffic from your cloud.  \n\n* *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic for MySQL (port 3306)* for Google Cloud Platform \n* *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on all ports* for Google Cloud Platform \n\n## **4. Missing encryption**\n\nWhen we’re considering encryption in the cloud, there are numerous cloud assets we need to have in mind. For example: \n\n* S3 buckets, \n* virtual machine disks, \n* databases and others. \n\nEncryption assures confidentiality. If your sensitive data is accidentally exposed or someone gains access to it, strong encryption can still protect it. \n\nTherefore, it is important to make sure your data is encrypted in the cloud. \n\n### **Solution**\n\nImplement strong encryption and use industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms with strong keys.  \n\nSome examples of controls implemented in Cyscale that check if encryption is correctly assured in your cloud environment are: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest* for AWS Cloud \n* *Ensure that 'Data encryption' is set to 'On' on a SQL Database* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK)* for Google Cloud Platform \n\n## **5. Disabled or unconfigured logging and monitoring**\n\nIt is extremely important to log actions taken in your cloud environment. This can help you: \n\n* identify mistakes and other misconfigurations \n* provide accountability for employees’ actions \n* notice suspicious behavior \n\nMoreover, a key feature would be having targeted alerts alongside logging. This can help you cut through the noise of logs. \n\nEffectiveness can be increased in this way because you do not have to skim through all of the generated logs, since targeted alerts point out specific problems.\n\n### **Solution**\n\nImplement logging and monitoring with automated, targeted alerts. \n\nSome of the many controls provided by Cyscale that help you configure logging correctly are: \n\n* *Ensure that activity log alert exists for the Delete Network Security Group Rule* for Microsoft Azure\n* *Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket* for AWS Cloud\n\n<br/>\n\nNow that we’ve looked at the most common cloud misconfigurations and showed you how to identify and fix them, make sure to check out [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/) to solidify your cloud security posture.  \n\nYou will find: \n\n* controls that check for the misconfigurations presented in this article and more,\n* an explanation of what those misconfigurations are,\n* instructions on how to fix them.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"5 Steps to Improve Your Company’s Cloud Security Posture","seoTitle":"5 Steps to Improve Your Company’s Cloud Security Posture","description":"Improve your company's cloud security posture by assuring discovery and visibility of cloud assets, detecting misconfigurations and applying remediation for them, ensuring logging and monitoring and assuring compliance with security standards.

Assure discovery and visibility of cloud assets** \n\nLooking at many configurations at once may become overwhelming very fast. \n\nIt is hard to notice flaws in your security design if discovery and visibility are not assured. \n\nDiscovery and visibility in cloud imply being able to visualize cloud assets in an organized and easily readable way, for example in a dashboard.  \n\nEven more useful is when visibility for each asset is enriched by additional context that may be provided in a graph view.\n\n![A graph from the Cyscale application.](/img/graph_image.webp#shadow \"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\")\n\nLooking at: \n\n* policies, \n* configurations, \n* connections between assets \n\nin a centralized fashion can help in pointing out: \n\n1. unnecessarily permissive rights \n2. vulnerabilities in your cloud configuration.  \n3. odd changes in your infrastructure. \n\nIt is critical to make sure that visibility is satisfied, in order to enable threat discovery. \n\nFor example, [a graph that maps networks of cloud assets. identities and workloads](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) can help you properly understand relationships, properties, and types of assets in your cloud environment. \n\nVisually examining the characteristics of your infrastructure may aid you in taking the right measures to improve security. \n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Detect misconfigurations** \n\nAccording to [Continuity Central](https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/7117-misconfiguration-was-the-number-one-cause-of-cloud-security-incidents-in-2021), misconfigurations in the cloud environment were the main cause of cloud security breaches in 2021. It is easy to overlook: \n\n* a badly configured access list (ACL) \n* a bad policy for access control \n* an open port that should not be there, and others. \n\nHumans make mistakes. Even a minor misconfiguration that does not impact the activity in your cloud may lead to catastrophic events such as: \n\n* public access to your containers, \n* malware intrusion, \n* lateral movement.  \n\nDiscovering these mistakes before they are exploited is critical.  \n\nIdeally, you should have an automated way to check for common cloud misconfigurations. \n\nWe will provide you with a solution later in this article to easily keep misconfigurations under control and be notified when new ones appear. \n\n<br/>\n\n**3. Implement remediation for findings** \n\nIt is not enough to only discover threats in your design. \n\nYou need to also be able to remediate the flaws in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nKnowing how to properly fix misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is a key factor in improving your cloud security. \n\nExamples of misconfigurations remediations are: \n\n* restricting overly permissive access to users, \n* closing unnecessarily open ports, \n* blocking inbound & outbound traffic. \n\n<br/>\n\n**4. Ensure logging and monitoring** \n\nIt is very important to catch threats before they become incidents.  \n\nA good measure to take is keeping logs and documenting every event that occurs. \n\nIn this case, **targeted alerts** can save your company from disaster by pinpointing: \n\n* misconfigurations \n* suspicious activity \n* attacks coming from outside.  \n\nSpotting threats immediately or within a short period of time may save your cloud environment from being breached. \n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Assure compliance with international standards** \n\nMaking sure that your company is compliant with international standards such as [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/) not only consolidates your data protection services but also shows your clients that you acknowledge the importance of cybersecurity. \n\nFollowing [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/) recommended by standards can greatly improve your cloud security posture. \n\nHowever, fulfilling all of the requirements consistently to become compliant with an international standard is a very tedious and time-consuming job. \n\nA solution to this would be automating controls and compliance checks that scan your platform for every requirement and show if you are fulfilling every request. \n\n<br/>\n\nWe have reached the end of the article and now you are probably wondering: \n\n**How do you implement all of the mentioned steps?** \n\nThe tasks described above can be implemented using a [CSPM product (Cloud Security Posture Management)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/).  \n\nCSPM is a component of cloud security that analyzes your cloud environment and alerts you on what controls are failing in your infrastructure. \n\nYour cloud security posture would be improved significantly and promptly when using a CSPM.  \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions to all of the problems raised in this article. \n\nWith Cyscale, you can: \n\n* get an overview of your assets and configurations, \n* easily manage misconfigurations, \n* receive targeted and precise alerts, \n* remediate accidents and flaws in your cloud environment faster, \n* become compliant with international standards. \n\nStart automating tasks, make these processes easier for you and generate reliable results, with [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/). \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","seoTitle":"SOC 2 vs ISO 27001: What every SaaS needs to know","description":"When looking into consolidating your data protection services, you may decide to implement SOC 2 or ISO 27001.

Security\n\n   * Contains Security Incidents\n   * Communicates Remediation Activities\n2. Availability\n\n   * Identify environmental threats\n   * Measure Current Usage\n3. Processing Integrity\n\n   * Create and maintain records of system inputs\n   * Defines processing activities\n4. Confidentiality\n\n   * Identify confidential information\n   * Destroy confidential information\n5. Privacy\n\n   * Use clear and conspicuous language\n   * Collect information from reliable sources\n\n**For ISO 27001**, you need to:\n\n1. Implement an ISMS (Information Security Management Systems)\n2. Fulfill **7 requirements with 114 suggested controls** divided into 14 sections.\n\nThe requirements are described in the following clauses:\n\n* Clause 4: Context of the organization\n* Clause 5: Leadership\n* Clause 6: Planning\n* Clause 7: Support\n* Clause 8: Operation\n* Clause 9: Performance evaluation\n* Clause 10: Improvement\n\nIn the Annex of ISO 27001, you can find a list of controls and objectives to help you meet the requirements.\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/ISO-27001-certification-standard-policies-procedures/).\n\n**Price (of audit)**\n\n* For SOC 2, the cost depends on the type of audit and can range **between $5,000 and $60,000** with an average of about $20,000.\n* For ISO 27001, the price of an audit depends on the number of employees in the organization. It can go **as low as $5,400 up to $27,000**.\n\nIt is important to note that the price of implementing the standards may significantly increase the total cost of obtaining the accreditation.\n\nOne thing to note is that, although SOC 2 and ISO 27001 seem very different, their specifications overlap.\n\nThe level of similarity between the requirements of the two depends on:\n\n* The type of business you run\n* The scope of the audit\n\nThe similarity can be between 53% and 90%, according to AICPA’s mapping to ISO 27001.\n\nTaking into account all of the differences and similarities of the SOC 2 accreditation and the ISO 27001 certification, you can now choose the best standard for your company.\n\nFinally, implementing all the policies required by the described standards can be a difficult and time-consuming task.\n\nYou can make this process easier for you.\n\nWith [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can ensure easy and continuous compliance for ISO 27001.\n\nCyscale helps you meet the much-needed requirements described by this standard.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":54,"numPages":8,"currentPage":7,"category":"All","seoTitle":"Blog Page 7 - Cyscale","seoDescription":"Cloud and Data Security Blog","categoriesList":["CSPM","CNAPP","Product","News","Compliance","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
