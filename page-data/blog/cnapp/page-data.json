A [cloud-native application](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) is an application that is intended for cloud, ran and hosted in the cloud. \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:  \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management),  \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management), and \n* Containers Security. \n\nIn this article, we will understand what features a CNAPP has, and why it is a necessary tool for protecting cloud-native applications. \n\n## Why is CNAPP needed?  \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture than non-native applications, it is essential to understand the key features cloud-native applications have and the security concerns that come with them. \n\n**How is the infrastructure different?** Cloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes, which can increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but can also introduce new concerns in terms of security.  \n\nThese types of applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs. \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP solution is necessary to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.  \n\nLet’s understand some of the features CNAPP solutions provide to secure cloud-native applications. \n\n### 1. Visibility\n\nContext-aware visibility is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Because of the complex nature of cloud-native applications, it can become challenging to understand issues regarding the underlying infrastructure. Visibility is ensured in CSPM platforms. \n\nFor example, even though microservices communicate with each other and the application is functioning correctly, vulnerabilities may still exist. A misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access.  \n\nTherefore, visibility features in CNAPP are important to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between cloud assets, applications and systems and automatically pinpoints security issues. [The graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities and provide visibility in your cloud environment. \n\n### 2. Security controls\n\nManually going through every cloud asset and configuration to check for vulnerabilities is not only a difficult task, but it can also become impossible in large cloud environments in which thousands of assets are in use.  \n\nTo solve this problem, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and provide guidance for remediating found issues. This mechanism saves time and reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP. \n\nFor example, you can see a control from the Cyscale platform in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-1-control.png\" alt=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIn Cyscale, you can find a collection of over 300 controls that check services across multiple cloud vendors and provide remediation steps for findings. \n\nWhen an asset does not pass a control, an alert is generated.  \n\nTargeted alerts that highlight vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a cloud environment are crucial; reacting to and fixing findings quickly can save a company from a breach. \n\nHowever, alert fatigue is a real problem that security teams deal with; receiving too many alerts can lead to security professionals ignoring important alerts. A good CNAPP solution deals with all of these problems and provides a sound alert system.  \n\nFor example, in the image below, you can see an alert that has been triggered. Alerts can be Open or Resolved, to indicate if the issue that generated the alert has been fixed. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-2-alert.png\" alt=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 3. Data security \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications, data security is a critical concern in companies administering them. By scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be exposed. \n\nUsing a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/), data security can be achieved for cloud-native applications. Security controls, as discussed in the previous section, enable organizations to identify misconfigurations or non-compliance with data security best practices in their cloud assets. \n\nIt is recommended that: \n\n* [At rest and in transit data are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/),  \n* Assets are not publicly accessible unless it is necessary, \n* Encryption keys are managed correctly in their entire lifecycle, and others. \n\nFor each of these best practices and more, Cyscale offers a wide variety of controls that cover AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies*, \n* *Ensure databases are not publicly accessible*, \n* *Ensure that Encryption key is rotated*. \n\nMoreover, in Cyscale, you can find a [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and encryption keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities. \n\n### 4. Compliance \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their [compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/) journey. The CSPM ([Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/)) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet various compliance frameworks.  \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to prepare for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards are: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR, \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/). \n\nCyscale supports all of them and more. You can view all supported standards on the Standards page, enable or disable frameworks, track progress with your compliance process, and view the cloud-focused requirements and associated controls for each of the standards.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-3-compliance.png\" alt=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 5. Container image scanning  \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.  \n\nFor example, if a container image uses **an unpatched version of Log4J**, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications running in that container. \n\n### 6. Cloud workloads protection \n\nCWPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/) and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them. \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes: \n\n* VMs,  \n* Containers,  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### 7. Kubernetes Cluster inspection \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It contains the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining, for example, which application is running in which container. \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior. \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are: \n\n* Unauthorized access,  \n* Missing patches,  \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### 8. IAM\n\n[IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) is another essential component of cloud-native applications security, specific to a CIEM platform. With complex cloud environments, it can become challenging to keep track of users, their different access levels, what impact certain permissions have, and so on. \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to the following aspects, but not limited to: \n\n1. Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making it more difficult to manage IAM. \n2. Cloud-native software is built to run in cloud environments, in multi-cloud as well as on-premises. \n3. The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing IAM identities at the service level. \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to secure their cloud in terms of IAM and manage identities.  \n\nSome best practices regarding IAM are: \n\n* **Implement multi-factor authentication for all users.** This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification. \n* **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity. \n* **Comply with the Least Privilege Principle** to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary. \n* **Assign permissions at group level** and assign very well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches. \n\nYou can read more about securing IAM in the cloud [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nTo ensure a deep understanding of user permissions and their impact, Cyscale provides an [Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-4-iam.png\" alt=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to their dynamic nature, their high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient. \n\nCNAPP solutions offer: \n\n* Visibility, \n* Compliance, \n* Data security, \n* Runtime protection, \n* Container image scanning, \n* Kubernetes cluster inspection, \n* IAM, and others. \n\nUse Cyscale to benefit from these features and secure your cloud environment! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["News","CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"A Word on Cloud Security","seoTitle":"A Word on Cloud Security","description":"Given all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen.

Or about security at all? Let’s zoom out even more and talk about the virtues we, as people, often desire for ourselves and look for in others. These include courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness. As Brian Tracy points out in his excellent book, “No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline”, all these virtues depend on and are guaranteed by one of them: **integrity**. Just like this, our software products have multiple requirements including functional (it must solve specific problems) and non-functional (performance, availability, efficiency, etc.). All these depend on the trust our users have in our systems to keep their data safe; they depend on **security**.\n\nIn theory, the most secure software is the one that doesn’t exist. If you have nothing, there is nothing to worry about. In practice, you will probably want to achieve certain things, to deliver certain features within a reasonable timeframe and budget. Luckily for us, the cloud providers offer a sizeable suite of services that might help us. In the era of data-driven, microservices-based, global-scale systems, we end up using some of them for compute (e.g. EC2, AKS, GKE, Lambda, Cloud Run), storage (S3), business intelligence (Redshift, Power BI), integration (Pub/Sub, Kinesis, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus), and so on. AWS even offers a service that lets you make use of their (satellite) ground stations. If you are competing with Elon’s Starlink or you are building a weather forecasting system, you might find it useful\n\n## Great Power, Great Responsibility\n\nNaturally, you must understand how to configure each cloud service you end up using and make them work together. One fundamental concept provided by the cloud is the way you manage access. You have control over both the network (so the service is actually reachable or not) and IAM (whether the clients must have identities and sufficient permissions). On one end of the spectrum, you can leave everything open and hope everyone expects that you have it properly set up. On the other end, you can choose a very restrictive configuration that might slow down your team. This is often known as the tradeoff between security and usability (for your dev team in this case). Over the past few years, the industry started shifting more toward security introducing concepts such as zero trust security and SSO (please make use of it whenever possible; also, it’s a shame that some companies still provide SSO only with their enterprise plans).\n\nClassically, you had a number of VMs (on-premises, VPS), installed and configured UFW, set up SSH access, and sent the SSH keys to your colleagues. Now, you can configure public and **private** (sub)networks, connect your cloud networks to your on-premises networks, deploy load balancers, define firewall rules without ever SSH-ing into the VMs, and assign identities and permissions to the VMs (and any other compute service). If previously your team didn’t interact too much with the infrastructure side, **now the infrastructure is part of the application**.\n\n## Network Access\n\nStarting with configuring the network access, here you have multiple options to control it. Perhaps the simplest concept is making the resources public or private. Your VM might have a vulnerable OS version, but if nothing can reach it and it cannot reach the internet, the risk is considerably lower. Not only can you run most compute and database services in a private network, but you can also configure fully managed services to be accessible through the provider's internal network (without traversing the internet) by leveraging services such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).\n\nFurthermore, you can (have to) configure firewalls. Here the services vary a bit. GCP calls them [VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls). You define them at the VPC level and can optionally choose to which instances they should apply based on tags (they are not equivalent to AWS/Azure tags. In GCP, the equivalent would be the resource labels) or service accounts (almost every resource can have an identity, which in GCP, is given by service accounts). In AWS, you work with security groups that are assigned to virtual machines. Besides allowing traffic (by default everything is denied) from certain IP addresses or CIDRs, you can also choose based on the security group of the source (please make use of this). You can also achieve this in Azure, but you have to combine two types of resources: network security groups (these are the actual firewalls) and application security groups (you can associate these with the network tags from GCP). In fact, here are the sources you can configure for each provider:\n\n* AWS: CIDRs, IP addresses, security groups, prefix lists (if you want to allow traffic coming only from certain AWS services)\n* Azure: CIDRs, IP addresses, application security groups, service tags (e.g. \\`AzureLoadBalancer\\`, \\`Internet\\`)\n* GCP: CIDRs, IP addresses, network tags (defined on each instance), service accounts\n\nOf course, this is not all. You also have network access control lists (NACLs), firewalls specific to each service (especially managed databases from Azure), NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPNs, virtual appliances, traffic splitting, firewalls that you install on the VMs, and a lot more. All these bring considerable complexity and make it extra difficult to configure the optimal **effective network access**.\n\nAdditionally, while there are tools that check the traffic in real-time, these are often dealing with network paths that you defined and are aware of. There might be paths you did not intend to leave open that an attacker might make us for **lateral movement**.\n\n## IAM Access\n\nNot only can every member of your organization have a user (or multiple) with access to certain parts of your infrastructure, but so does almost every compute resource. Just like you provide John with permission to read data from a bucket, so you assign a role to a VM achieving the same access. The difference is that anything that runs on the VM and everyone who can access it (i.e. SSH into it) now can do everything the VM can do.\n\nFundamentally, this mechanism of assigning roles to resources is excellent. You have clear visibility of the principals (users, resources) that can access a given service, you can grant or revoke access at any moment, and you have a meaningful trail of access logs. The alternative is often based on keys/secrets and is almost impossible to trace properly because anyone that has the key can access the resource (it’s easy to lose track of who has the key) (secret scanners help a bit here but are limited to the resources they run on).\n\nWe just have to understand its implications. If attackers manage to break into a VM and if that VM has high (excessive?) permissions, the attackers will not only be able to access our data, but they will also be able to spin up additional instances (crypto mining?) and delete existing resources (service disruption and data loss).\n\nAgain, here it’s important to understand the effective permissions each resource has. There are multiple factors that contribute to the effective permissions such as the role assigned to the resource, permissions inherited from group memberships or from assignments at a higher level (the VM might be an owner at the subscription level in Azure thus having access to everything in that subscription), and policies configured on the target resources such as [resource policies in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) and [access policies for Azure Key Vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/security-features).\n\nAnother important aspect about effective permissions in the context of data access is encryption, especially encryption with customer-managed keys. For example, if you store data on S3 and encrypt it with a key managed by AWS KMS, you must have access to both the S3 bucket/object and the encryption key from KMS. Managing encryption keys deserves an article on its own.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nEven if you have pristine infrastructure security, you still must provide access to someone (at least two admins so one doesn’t lock himself out by mistake - aka admin redundancy) to maintain the infrastructure and manage access for everyone else. This is an example of a highly privileged user. This in itself is not a major risk. However, if highly privileged users don’t have strong authentication mechanisms in place (MFA, preferably with strong factors), they can become liabilities. We are all subject to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n\nWhen you find out that an attacker managed to gain access to a highly privileged user, after revoking the sessions and rotating the credentials, you will want to find out the impact. For this, you need to know the systems to which the user has access. This can be quite challenging since the permissions are often spread across multiple systems.\n\nFor example, if you have Okta as the identity provider and AWS for the cloud infrastructure, you have to check both systems and link the results in order to determine what a person actually has access to. In Okta you just provide access to an application, but in AWS that application is often an AWS Organization with multiple accounts.\n\n## Ending Notes\n\nGiven all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen. However, we can go fast and build secure systems. It’s not a zero-sum game. You probably have people in your organization that are naturally passionate about security. Give them the responsibility, the training, and the tools. You probably don’t need that many people to do security full-time since the tools are getting increasingly powerful."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: A mix of CSPM & CWPP","seoTitle":null,"description":"Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform.\n\nAccording to Gartner, “CNAPP is an integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to help secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.”\n\nThe legitimate question would be: Why do I need another security tool?","seoDescription":null,"date":"2021-11-24T15:35:49.333Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cnapp-a-mix-of-cspm-cwpp","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/cspm-cwpp.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/0f481/cspm-cwpp.png","srcSet":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/d8077/cspm-cwpp.png 205w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/36293/cspm-cwpp.png 410w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/0f481/cspm-cwpp.png 820w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/6ef45/cspm-cwpp.png 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/19b88/cspm-cwpp.webp 205w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/f7577/cspm-cwpp.webp 410w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/1946f/cspm-cwpp.webp 820w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/d54ec/cspm-cwpp.webp 1640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":547}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"<!--StartFragment-->\n\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was clear that more and more companies were adopting a cloud-first strategy.\n\nOver the last 2 years, the number of companies using the services of at least one public cloud provider continued to grow.\n\nAs a result, Gartner predicted that by the end of 2021 “public cloud deployments will outnumber private data center workloads”.\n\nOnce again, security specialists insist that cloud security is a complex subject that should be considered a high priority.\n\nThere already are a lot of tools to take into consideration when you're concerned with cloud security.

CWPPs focus on the applications running in the cloud.\n\n## **Which is better? CNAPP vs CSPM+CWPP**\n\nThe increasing features overlap between these two solutions will make this \"merge\" inevitable.\n\n You can still use separate tools, or you can try a CNAPP, that's entirely up to you.\n\n#### ***Advantages of using CNAPP:***\n\n* better visibility and control of cloud-native application risk (when using separate tools, the identification and remediation actions can be fragmented, and not as efficient as having it all in one tool)\n* better collaboration for development and operations teams\n* simpler CI/CD pipelines (reduced complexity and cost since fewer tools are involved)\n* it scans all the source code, containers, VM images, IaC scripts, API\n\n#### ***Advantages of using separate tools:***\n\nThe most important one is the *maturity of the tools*.\n\nYou need to consider that Gartner expects this new category to have a high impact, but also predicts that it will take five to ten years before CNAPP is established in regular use.\n\nSince this is a new category of products, the market for CNAPP has just started to evolve and vendors need time to integrate all these capabilities.\n\nCWPP vendors have started to add new features capabilities, including IaC scanning.\n\nSome CSPMs have cutting edge-technology in place and can already give you some of the features promised by the CNAPP.\n\nThis is the case of Cyscale Cloud Platform, the solution that offers advanced visibility, but more importantly, gives you context so you can better prioritize.\\\nThe [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/)™ built within the platform may reveal, for example, that one of the resources usually reported to have a high-security risk, is not as vulnerable as it seems. (Let's think about a VM that has unencrypted disks attached, but is not being used in a production environment, or is not externally accessible from the internet).\\\nThis type of approach can make you realize that you need a more advanced risk analysis and a look beyond the classic list of logs, where the vulnerable components are reported without taking into consideration the bigger picture.\n\nRegardless of your choice of tool, just remember to give security posture the importance it deserves.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"CNAPP","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CNAPP","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CNAPP","categoriesList":["CNAPP","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
