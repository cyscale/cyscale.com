Or about security at all? Let’s zoom out even more and talk about the virtues we, as people, often desire for ourselves and look for in others. These include courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness. As Brian Tracy points out in his excellent book, “No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline”, all these virtues depend on and are guaranteed by one of them: **integrity**. Just like this, our software products have multiple requirements including functional (it must solve specific problems) and non-functional (performance, availability, efficiency, etc.). All these depend on the trust our users have in our systems to keep their data safe; they depend on **security**.\n\nIn theory, the most secure software is the one that doesn’t exist. If you have nothing, there is nothing to worry about. In practice, you will probably want to achieve certain things, to deliver certain features within a reasonable timeframe and budget. Luckily for us, the cloud providers offer a sizeable suite of services that might help us. In the era of data-driven, microservices-based, global-scale systems, we end up using some of them for compute (e.g. EC2, AKS, GKE, Lambda, Cloud Run), storage (S3), business intelligence (Redshift, Power BI), integration (Pub/Sub, Kinesis, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus), and so on. AWS even offers a service that lets you make use of their (satellite) ground stations. If you are competing with Elon’s Starlink or you are building a weather forecasting system, you might find it useful\n\n## Great Power, Great Responsibility\n\nNaturally, you must understand how to configure each cloud service you end up using and make them work together. One fundamental concept provided by the cloud is the way you manage access. You have control over both the network (so the service is actually reachable or not) and IAM (whether the clients must have identities and sufficient permissions). On one end of the spectrum, you can leave everything open and hope everyone expects that you have it properly set up. On the other end, you can choose a very restrictive configuration that might slow down your team. This is often known as the tradeoff between security and usability (for your dev team in this case). Over the past few years, the industry started shifting more toward security introducing concepts such as zero trust security and SSO (please make use of it whenever possible; also, it’s a shame that some companies still provide SSO only with their enterprise plans).\n\nClassically, you had a number of VMs (on-premises, VPS), installed and configured UFW, set up SSH access, and sent the SSH keys to your colleagues. Now, you can configure public and **private** (sub)networks, connect your cloud networks to your on-premises networks, deploy load balancers, define firewall rules without ever SSH-ing into the VMs, and assign identities and permissions to the VMs (and any other compute service). If previously your team didn’t interact too much with the infrastructure side, **now the infrastructure is part of the application**.\n\n## Network Access\n\nStarting with configuring the network access, here you have multiple options to control it. Perhaps the simplest concept is making the resources public or private. Your VM might have a vulnerable OS version, but if nothing can reach it and it cannot reach the internet, the risk is considerably lower. Not only can you run most compute and database services in a private network, but you can also configure fully managed services to be accessible through the provider's internal network (without traversing the internet) by leveraging services such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).\n\nFurthermore, you can (have to) configure firewalls. Here the services vary a bit. GCP calls them [VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls). You define them at the VPC level and can optionally choose to which instances they should apply based on tags (they are not equivalent to AWS/Azure tags. In GCP, the equivalent would be the resource labels) or service accounts (almost every resource can have an identity, which in GCP, is given by service accounts). In AWS, you work with security groups that are assigned to virtual machines. Besides allowing traffic (by default everything is denied) from certain IP addresses or CIDRs, you can also choose based on the security group of the source (please make use of this). You can also achieve this in Azure, but you have to combine two types of resources: network security groups (these are the actual firewalls) and application security groups (you can associate these with the network tags from GCP). In fact, here are the sources you can configure for each provider:\n\n* AWS: CIDRs, IP addresses, security groups, prefix lists (if you want to allow traffic coming only from certain AWS services)\n* Azure: CIDRs, IP addresses, application security groups, service tags (e.g. \\`AzureLoadBalancer\\`, \\`Internet\\`)\n* GCP: CIDRs, IP addresses, network tags (defined on each instance), service accounts\n\nOf course, this is not all. You also have network access control lists (NACLs), firewalls specific to each service (especially managed databases from Azure), NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPNs, virtual appliances, traffic splitting, firewalls that you install on the VMs, and a lot more. All these bring considerable complexity and make it extra difficult to configure the optimal **effective network access**.\n\nAdditionally, while there are tools that check the traffic in real-time, these are often dealing with network paths that you defined and are aware of. There might be paths you did not intend to leave open that an attacker might make us for **lateral movement**.\n\n## IAM Access\n\nNot only can every member of your organization have a user (or multiple) with access to certain parts of your infrastructure, but so does almost every compute resource. Just like you provide John with permission to read data from a bucket, so you assign a role to a VM achieving the same access. The difference is that anything that runs on the VM and everyone who can access it (i.e. SSH into it) now can do everything the VM can do.\n\nFundamentally, this mechanism of assigning roles to resources is excellent. You have clear visibility of the principals (users, resources) that can access a given service, you can grant or revoke access at any moment, and you have a meaningful trail of access logs. The alternative is often based on keys/secrets and is almost impossible to trace properly because anyone that has the key can access the resource (it’s easy to lose track of who has the key) (secret scanners help a bit here but are limited to the resources they run on).\n\nWe just have to understand its implications. If attackers manage to break into a VM and if that VM has high (excessive?) permissions, the attackers will not only be able to access our data, but they will also be able to spin up additional instances (crypto mining?) and delete existing resources (service disruption and data loss).\n\nAgain, here it’s important to understand the effective permissions each resource has. There are multiple factors that contribute to the effective permissions such as the role assigned to the resource, permissions inherited from group memberships or from assignments at a higher level (the VM might be an owner at the subscription level in Azure thus having access to everything in that subscription), and policies configured on the target resources such as [resource policies in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) and [access policies for Azure Key Vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/security-features).\n\nAnother important aspect about effective permissions in the context of data access is encryption, especially encryption with customer-managed keys. For example, if you store data on S3 and encrypt it with a key managed by AWS KMS, you must have access to both the S3 bucket/object and the encryption key from KMS. Managing encryption keys deserves an article on its own.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nEven if you have pristine infrastructure security, you still must provide access to someone (at least two admins so one doesn’t lock himself out by mistake - aka admin redundancy) to maintain the infrastructure and manage access for everyone else. This is an example of a highly privileged user. This in itself is not a major risk. However, if highly privileged users don’t have strong authentication mechanisms in place (MFA, preferably with strong factors), they can become liabilities. We are all subject to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n\nWhen you find out that an attacker managed to gain access to a highly privileged user, after revoking the sessions and rotating the credentials, you will want to find out the impact. For this, you need to know the systems to which the user has access. This can be quite challenging since the permissions are often spread across multiple systems.\n\nFor example, if you have Okta as the identity provider and AWS for the cloud infrastructure, you have to check both systems and link the results in order to determine what a person actually has access to. In Okta you just provide access to an application, but in AWS that application is often an AWS Organization with multiple accounts.\n\n## Ending Notes\n\nGiven all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen. However, we can go fast and build secure systems. It’s not a zero-sum game. You probably have people in your organization that are naturally passionate about security. Give them the responsibility, the training, and the tools. You probably don’t need that many people to do security full-time since the tools are getting increasingly powerful."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: A mix of CSPM & CWPP","seoTitle":null,"description":"Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform.\n\nAccording to Gartner, “CNAPP is an integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to help secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.”\n\nThe legitimate question would be: Why do I need another security tool?","seoDescription":null,"date":"2021-11-24T15:35:49.333Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"cnapp-a-mix-of-cspm-cwpp","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/cspm-cwpp.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/0f481/cspm-cwpp.png","srcSet":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/d8077/cspm-cwpp.png 205w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/36293/cspm-cwpp.png 410w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/0f481/cspm-cwpp.png 820w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/6ef45/cspm-cwpp.png 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/19b88/cspm-cwpp.webp 205w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/f7577/cspm-cwpp.webp 410w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/1946f/cspm-cwpp.webp 820w,\n/static/0d623661be987ab7298a9d413fe49939/d54ec/cspm-cwpp.webp 1640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":547}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"<!--StartFragment-->\n\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was clear that more and more companies were adopting a cloud-first strategy.\n\nOver the last 2 years, the number of companies using the services of at least one public cloud provider continued to grow.\n\nAs a result, Gartner predicted that by the end of 2021 “public cloud deployments will outnumber private data center workloads”.\n\nOnce again, security specialists insist that cloud security is a complex subject that should be considered a high priority.\n\nThere already are a lot of tools to take into consideration when you're concerned with cloud security. Up until now, cloud professionals were talking about three main security solutions: [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).\n\nBut recently, Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform.\n\nAccording to Gartner, “CNAPP is an integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to help secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.”\n\nThe legitimate question would be: ***Why do I need another security tool?***\n\nWell, the idea is to focus not only on your cloud infrastructure's security configurations but also on your applications that run in the cloud.\n\nYou could argue that your CWPP or your CSPM is already doing something about this - and you would be right!\n\nIf you dig deeper, CNAPP is basically a mix of 2 separate solutions:  Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) & Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)\n\n### What is CSPM?\n\n[Cloud Security Posture Management solutions (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) have as main purpose the [detection of misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). They will continuously monitor the cloud environment in order to provide visibility across multi-cloud and alert the company about compliance drift or risky behavior. CSPMs focus on cloud infrastructure.\n\n### What is CWPP?\n\nCloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs) are designed to protect the workloads deployed in the cloud. They will perform vulnerability assessments and handle the security of the applications. Based on assessment results, you can implement security controls or you can remediate the threats. CWPPs focus on the applications running in the cloud.\n\n## **Which is better? CNAPP vs CSPM+CWPP**\n\nThe increasing features overlap between these two solutions will make this \"merge\" inevitable.\n\n You can still use separate tools, or you can try a CNAPP, that's entirely up to you.\n\n#### ***Advantages of using CNAPP:***\n\n* better visibility and control of cloud-native application risk (when using separate tools, the identification and remediation actions can be fragmented, and not as efficient as having it all in one tool)\n* better collaboration for development and operations teams\n* simpler CI/CD pipelines (reduced complexity and cost since fewer tools are involved)\n* it scans all the source code, containers, VM images, IaC scripts, API\n\n#### ***Advantages of using separate tools:***\n\nThe most important one is the *maturity of the tools*.\n\nYou need to consider that Gartner expects this new category to have a high impact, but also predicts that it will take five to ten years before CNAPP is established in regular use.\n\nSince this is a new category of products, the market for CNAPP has just started to evolve and vendors need time to integrate all these capabilities.\n\nCWPP vendors have started to add new features capabilities, including IaC scanning.\n\nSome CSPMs have cutting edge-technology in place and can already give you some of the features promised by the CNAPP.\n\nThis is the case of Cyscale Cloud Platform, the solution that offers advanced visibility, but more importantly, gives you context so you can better prioritize.\\\nThe [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/)™ built within the platform may reveal, for example, that one of the resources usually reported to have a high-security risk, is not as vulnerable as it seems. (Let's think about a VM that has unencrypted disks attached, but is not being used in a production environment, or is not externally accessible from the internet).\\\nThis type of approach can make you realize that you need a more advanced risk analysis and a look beyond the classic list of logs, where the vulnerable components are reported without taking into consideration the bigger picture.\n\nRegardless of your choice of tool, just remember to give security posture the importance it deserves.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"CNAPP","seoTitle":"Cyscale - CNAPP","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale CNAPP","categoriesList":["Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","Engineering"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
