But while these developments have made it easier than ever to deploy applications, they have dramatically changed the landscape in terms of security.   \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture to traditional non-native applications, it is essential to understand how the key features of cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns and are driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) as a result.  \n\n## How is cloud-native infrastructure different?  \n\nCloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes. Cloud-native applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). \n\nThese technologies significantly increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but they introduce new concerns in terms of security along with a much larger attack surface area.   \n\n## What is a CNAPP? \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP is becoming a necessary solution to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.   \n\nCoined by Gartner, [cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are described as a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.  \n\nOne of the key features being that CNAPPs consolidate several previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), runtime cloud workload protection and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning, into one solution. \n\nThis guide will help you understand the most important features of a CNAPP that secure cloud-native applications and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:   \n\n* [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) (Cloud Security Posture Management)   \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)  \n* [CIEM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iam-security/) (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management)  \n* [KSPM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/kubernetes-security-platform/) (Kubernetes Security Posture Management)  \n* Container Security \n\n**G﻿et an overview of CNAPP capabilities**\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/Cyscale-explainer-video-2023-12-Dec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n## Visibility of cloud-native infrastructure \n\nWhereas traditional environments relied largely on proprietary software, isolated hardware, and almost total control of the stack, cloud-native environments may stretch across multiple clouds, make use of open-source code, require identity-based segmentation, and feature ephemeral workloads.   \n\nAs a result, context-aware visibility of all these assets and resources is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Not only is the surface area for attack dramatically increased, you also need to determine whether a vulnerability in one resource is innocuous or if it creates a toxic combination through its relationship with other assets.   \n\nA misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access and serve as a jumping-off point to more resources, for example.   \n\nTherefore, the visibility features found in CSPM solutions are incorporated into CNAPP to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. Usually, visibility comes in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can illustrate current security scores, assets that need your attention, and other elements that may help you understand your cloud. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see all your cloud resources in one place, so as to be constantly aware of your cloud environment? \n* Does it provide full coverage and visibility into your cloud estate and risks, including cloud configuration, workload, and identity? \n* Does it bring your multi-cloud infrastructure together in one tool and deliver risk-aware context? \n* Does it identify assets that might or have drifted from your organization’s compliance baseline? \n\n## Cloud-native security controls  \n\nManually going through every cloud asset configuration to check for issues and vulnerabilities is tedious and error prone in smaller estates and impossible in large cloud environments where thousands of assets are in use. Don’t forget that the approach for AWS is different to that of Azure, is different to Google Cloud, and different again with Kubernetes.   \n\nA certified expert in one environment does not equal transferable skills to another.  \n\nTo solve these challenges, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and either automate the remediation of or provide guidance to address issues. The application of automation, using Machine Learning and AI, not only saves considerable time but reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP provide contextual triaging and prioritization or send targeted alerts for high-priority assets to reduce and relieve alert fatigue? \n* Does it detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, enabling you to react and fix findings quickly, saving your organization from a breach? \n* Does it deliver efficient remediation steps on detected issues? \n\n## Data security in the cloud \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications with ephemeral workloads and infrastructure that is scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be unwittingly exposed. Through DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, CNAPPs can help keep track of data stores and provide actionable suggestions for your organization to secure your crown jewels. \n\nA CNAPP will detect and highlight unencrypted storage resources, cryptographic keys with insecure configurations or upcoming expirations, assets that are publicly accessible, and other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may leave your organization’s sensitive data exposed.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Are the Data Security Dashboard capabilities of the CNAPP capable of pinpointing blind spots in your infrastructure? \n* Some cloud providers encrypt data in storage resources by default, while others do not so it is easy to overlook what you think you know and miss important details. Does the CNAPP help you understand your encryption status? \n* Instead of dealing with cryptographic key rotation and deletion, some CNAPPs show you what keys need to be rotated and when. Does the CNAPP provide this capability? \n\n## Container image scanning   \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.   \n\nRetroactively, a CNAPP can identify which container images have vulnerabilities and where those images are running in your infrastructure. \n\nFor example, if a container image uses an unpatched version of Log4J, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications in that container.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP check container images for vulnerabilities to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your infrastructure? \n* Does the CNAPP help you understand who has permissions over containers to prevent unauthorized access? \n* Are you able to monitor for and identify any misconfigurations developers might have missed when spinning up containers? \n\n## Cloud workloads protection  \n\nThe Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) component of a CNAPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in CVEs and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them.  \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes:  \n\n* VMs \n* Containers  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see running workloads in one dashboard to easily keep you up to date with your organization’s activity all the time? \n* Does it help you prioritize vulnerable workloads efficiently based on severity to ensure effective remediation measures? \n* Does it automatically keep up with emerging threats, so you don’t have to check the news all the time? Your CNAPP should do the work for you by constantly checking your workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\n## Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior.  \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are:  \n\n* Unauthorized access   \n* Missing patches   \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP give you visibility of your Kubernetes objects? \n* Does it help you assess your cluster based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark, which contains up-to-date and industry-standard best practices? \n* Does it detect vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster with no need for manual effort from your team? You should be able to see where you have Kubernetes images with vulnerabilities and where those images are deployed.  \n\n## CIEM and IAM: Access management   \n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is an essential component of cloud-native applications security specific to the CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) part of the platform. With complex cloud environments, keeping track of users and services, their different access levels, and what impact certain permissions have can become challenging.  \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to, but not limited to, the following aspects:  \n\n* Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making them more difficult to manage  \n* Cloud-native software may run across multi-cloud environments as well as on-premises  \n* The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing identities at the service level \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to better secure their cloud in terms of identity and access management.   \n\n## Best practices regarding IAM:  \n\n* Implement multi-factor authentication for all users. This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification  \n* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity  \n* Comply with the Least Privilege Principle to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary for the user to do their job  \n* Assign permissions at group level and assign well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP identify any drifts from your company’s security or compliance posture using a powerful IAM dashboard that pinpoints users with issues, such as the ones that do not have MFA enabled? \n* Does the CNAPP give you an understanding of your password policies and identify if users have old passwords? \n* Does it help you understand if users or groups have more permissions than necessary? \n* Does the CNAPP support you in performing effective access reviews that don’t take all day and require no manual work? \n* Does it help you gain confidence in your organization’s security posture? \n\n## Compliance  \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their compliance journey. The CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet the requirements of various compliance frameworks.   \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to perform assessments in preparation for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards a CNAPP should provide support for are are:  \n\n* ISO 27001   \n* SOC 2  \n* GDPR  \n* PCI-DSS  \n* HIPAA  \n* NIST \n\nOther standards like DORA are becoming increasingly important for some sectors, and there are regional equivalents of some regulations like Brazil’s LGDP data protection laws. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP help you track your compliance progress in real-time and ensure you are able to understand how your organization is doing in terms of compliance posture? \n* Does the CNAPP keep a track record of your efforts that can be presented during an audit? \n* Are all of your organization's cloud resources tracked in one place, so you know that the compliance assessment is comprehensive and accurate and you're not missing anything? \n* Can you view your compliance score at-a-glance and at any time? \n* Are you able to export detailed reports to help explain your security and compliance posture to other stakeholders or to help you make a case to the board? \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/full-platform-tour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">TAKE A TOUR OF CYSCALE'S CNAPP</button></a></div>\n\n## Summary: CNAPP as a critical part of cloud-native security \n\nAs cloud-native application development has penetrated the market, it has not only expanded the infrastructure estate but also the number of teams involved, from devops, to platform engineers, cloud architects, security experts, compliance practitioners, and more.  \n\nLikewise, security solutions have evolved in tandem, moving beyond the more static nature of the CSPM, to the more dynamic capabilities of a CNAPP, with an integrated, lifecycle security and compliance approach to protecting workloads and applications. \n\nThe vendor landscape is competitive and vendor portfolios have either grown through acquisition or original development. The result is that many established vendor CNAPP offerings are bolted together point solutions with little or no integration.  \n\nCloud-native organizations going down this route will need to ensure they have the resources available to learn and operate several different tools and even take on some of the work around correlation and context in cloud security.  \n\nThe main concern with challenger or incoming CNAPP vendors, on the other hand, might be a lack of maturity in the components, even though the platform itself is designed with integration in mind.  \n\nOrganizations will need to carefully assess the capabilities of the CNAPP solution to ensure it meets their specific needs, without requiring too many resources or investments, and with room for future growth.  \n\nThat said, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are regarded as a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, its high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient.  \n\n### C﻿hoosing a CNAPP\n\n**Overall, CNAPP solutions offer:**  \n\n1.

ECS enables users to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.  \n\nIn this article, we will explore:  \n\n* what ECS is,  \n* how it works,  \n* common vulnerabilities, and most importantly,  \n* container security best practices to maximize cybersecurity on the ECS platform. \n\n## Understanding Amazon ECS \n\nAmazon ECS is a container orchestration service that simplifies the deployment and management of containers on AWS. It allows you to run containers at scale without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nECS provides the flexibility to choose between two launch types: EC2 and Fargate. With the EC2 launch type, containers are run on EC2 instances that you have to manage, while with Fargate, AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you only focus on deploying and scaling containers. \n\n## What is Amazon ECS used for? \n\nECS is a service suitable for a wide range of use cases, such as \n\n* **microservices architecture**: ECS enables you to break down your application into smaller, independently deployable microservices, facilitating scalability and flexibility. \n* **batch processing**: ECS simplifies the execution of batch workloads by running containers in parallel, optimizing resource utilization, and reducing processing time. \n* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: With ECS, you can build an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying containerized applications, ensuring faster and efficient software delivery. \n* **web applications**: ECS is ideal for hosting web apps, providing automatic scaling capabilities, load balancing, and seamless integration with other AWS services. \n\n## Common Vulnerabilities \n\nWhile ECS provides a robust container management framework, it's crucial to be aware of common vulnerabilities that can impact containerized apps: \n\n* **Inadequate IAM permissions**: Misconfigured AWS IAM roles and policies can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation within ECS. \n* **Vulnerable container images**: Using outdated or insecure container images that contain known security vulnerabilities can expose applications to exploitation and malware. \n* **Weak network security**: Misconfigured security groups, improper network isolation, or exposure of unnecessary ports are a few examples that can lead to unauthorized access to containers or sensitive data. \n* **Lack of logging and monitoring**: Insufficient monitoring and logging of ECS services can make detecting and responding to security incidents challenging. \n\n## Best practices for containers security on ECS \n\nSecure your production environments and improve your cloud security posture by following the best practices described in this article. \n\n### 1. Implement IAM best practices\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege by assigning granular IAM roles to ECS tasks and services. Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and follow AWS security best practices. Enforce strong password rules to ensure secure authentication. \n\n### 2. Secure container images \n\nUtilize secure container base images from trusted sources. Perform regular image scanning for new vulnerabilities and update container images. Leverage Dockerfile best practices to create secure and efficient Docker container images. \n\n### 3. Configure network security \n\nLeverage security groups and network ACLs to enforce fine-grained network traffic access controls for ECS containers. Only expose necessary ports and protocols, and use encryption for data in transit. Implement network segmentation by allowing connectivity only between the containers that truly need it and isolating the rest. Utilize Kubernetes network security policies to control the traffic between containers. Avoid using public IP addresses for ECS instances to prevent unintended access to your app servers. \n\n### 4. Enable logging and monitoring\n\nEnable detailed logging for ECS services and applications. Utilize AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize logs for monitoring and analysis and turn on Container Insights for your ECS clusters. Continuous monitoring can help you identify security issues at container runtime. \n\n### 5. Manage dependencies and vulnerabilities \n\nRegularly update and patch the host operating system and other software dependencies used within your container images. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in your containerized applications. If you’re using Fargate, ensure the services are running on the latest Fargate platform version; new updates come with security patches and bug fixes.  \n\n### 6. Do not run containers as the root user \n\nRunning containers with high privileges can increase the attack surface by allowing attackers to take advantage of this misconfiguration and “escape” the containers, obtaining high privileges on the host virtual machine. This breaks the isolation of containers. Run your ECS containers as non-privileged by setting the *privileged* parameter in the container definition to *false*. \n\nMitigate security risks by implementing the recommended best practices and secure your container environment. \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale provides a Containers dashboard, where you can see what assets are using them and other details about containers, as well as controls that check for ECS misconfigurations and provide alerting and remediation steps to fix findings in no time.  \n\nSome examples of security controls that you can find on the Cyscale platform are: \n\n* *Ensure ECS services don't have public IP addresses assigned to them automatically*\n* *Ensure ECS clusters use Container Insights*\n* *Ensure ECS containers run as non-privileged*\n* *Ensure ECS containers are limited to read-only access to root filesystems*\n\n\n\nCyscale - Your Trusted [Cloud Security Company](https://cyscale.com): \n\nTo ensure complete protection of your Amazon ECS instances, Cyscale offers a comprehensive Cloud Security Platform.

Containers are a lightweight solution that allows applications to run independently of operating systems. Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies and provide numerous benefits, such as: \n\n* **Portability.** Because containers encapsulate everything needed to run applications, they can be moved between environments without causing the need for additional libraries or other tools. \n* **Consistency.** By including all the needed dependencies in a container image, an app will work the same across different machines; no more \"it works on my machine\". \n* **Scalability.** By leveraging container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, you can dynamically scale containers based on demand, allowing your application to handle varying workloads effectively. \n* **Isolation.** Since the app has its own environment, it is isolated from other resources. This adds a layer of security.  \n\n## Container images vulnerabilities \n\nContainers have many advantages. However, they can also introduce unique vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure. Let’s look at some of them to fully understand the impact of using containerization. \n\n### 1. Vulnerable libraries. \n\nContainer images often contain third-party libraries and dependencies. It is not uncommon for libraries to have known vulnerabilities.  \n\nRegularly scanning and updating these dependencies is critical to reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Insecure configurations \n\nMisconfigured container images can lead to the compromise of confidentiality of data, unauthorized access, and others. Examples of insecure settings include: \n\n* Weak access control, \n* The usage of environment variables to pass sensitive information (such as passwords or API keys), \n* Poor network settings, such as unnecessary open ports. \n\n### 3. Outdated software \n\nContainer images may contain outdated frameworks, operating systems, and libraries. If they are not regularly updated, they may have vulnerabilities. Run your applications on updated OSs and use newer versions of frameworks and libraries to ensure that your infrastructure is patched! \n\n## Common best practices \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of best practices that you should follow when using container images or when creating them: \n\n1. ### Ensure visibility in your cloud environment \n\nContainers are widely used in cloud environments due to their scalability and efficiency. To understand how container images affect your security posture, you need to gain visibility in your cloud infrastructure and grasp the context of every image in use by: \n\n* mapping cloud resources to the images they’re using, \n* identifying which of those assets have access to critical data, \n* assessing the container image configurations. \n\n2. ### Use trusted base images \n\nOnly utilize trusted images from known, reputable sources to ensure that the container images you're using are patched and have undergone security reviews. These images are not guaranteed to be completely secure, but it's a good starting point. \n\n3. ### Perform regular updates \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, patch container images to avoid the use of outdated or vulnerable frameworks, libraries or operating systems.  \n\n4. ### Scan your container images for vulnerabilities \n\nScan images regularly for known vulnerabilities and make sure to address any findings. Reduce the attack surface and obtain insights into vulnerabilities present in the software components of a container image. \n\n5. ### Harden your container image \n\nReduce the attack surface of your containerized applications: \n\n1. Implement [the least privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege): do not run processes as root to prevent the possibility of privilege escalation inside your container. \n2. Disable unnecessary services and functionalities: minimize potential entry points for attackers by disabling tools that are not required. \n3. Restrict ports accessibility: do not leave networks ports open unnecessarily. \n\n## Container images – where are they present? \n\nContainer images can be used in various cloud-based services across public cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.  \n\nThese services leverage container images to enable the seamless deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. \n\nExamples of services that run container images are: \n\n* ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service), EKS (Amazon Kubernetes Service) \n* AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), \n* GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), and others. \n\n\n\nContainers form the foundation of modern cloud-based application deployment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand their purpose, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices for securing them. By implementing the recommended best practices and staying informed about emerging threats, your organization can secure container environments and ensure the safety of cloud-based applications. \n\nIn the dynamic landscape of cloud security, continuous learning and adaptation are paramount. As containerization continues to revolutionize the cloud industry, maintaining a strong focus on container image security will help organizations stay ahead of potential threats and safeguard their valuable assets.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Virginia Mitea","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: A mix of CSPM & CWPP","seoTitle":"CNAPP: A mix of CSPM & CWPP - Cyscale","description":"Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform.\n\nAccording to Gartner, “CNAPP is an integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to help secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.”\n\nThe legitimate question would be: Why do I need another security tool?","seoDescription":"Unveil CNAPP, a blend of CSPM & CWPP for advanced cloud security.

Up until now, cloud professionals were talking about three main security solutions: [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB).\n\nBut recently, Gartner has defined a new category that is focused on securing cloud services and cloud-native applications, the so-called CNAPP- Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform. CNAPP combines the capabilities of Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) to provide comprehensive [cloud native application security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) across development and production environments.\n\nThe legitimate question would be: ***Why do I need another security tool?***\n\nWell, the idea is to focus not only on your [cloud infrastructure's security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) configurations but also on your applications that run in the cloud.\n\nYou could argue that your CWPP or your CSPM is already doing something about this - and you would be right!\n\nIf you dig deeper, CNAPP is basically a mix of 2 separate solutions:  Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) & Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)\n\n### What is CSPM?\n\n[Cloud Security Posture Management solutions (CSPM)](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) have as main purpose the [detection of misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). They will continuously monitor the cloud environment in order to provide visibility across multi-cloud and alert the company about compliance drift or risky behavior. CSPMs focus on cloud infrastructure.\n\n### What is CWPP?\n\nCloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs) are designed to protect the workloads deployed in the cloud. They will perform vulnerability assessments and handle the security of the applications. Based on assessment results, you can implement security controls or you can remediate the threats. CWPPs focus on the applications running in the cloud.\n\n## **Which is better? CNAPP vs CSPM+CWPP**\n\nThe increasing features overlap between these two solutions will make this \"merge\" inevitable.\n\n You can still use separate tools, or you can try a CNAPP, that's entirely up to you.\n\n#### ***Advantages of using CNAPP:***\n\n* better visibility and control of cloud-native application risk (when using separate tools, the identification and remediation actions can be fragmented, and not as efficient as having it all in one tool)\n* better collaboration for development and operations teams\n* simpler CI/CD pipelines (reduced complexity and cost since fewer tools are involved)\n* it scans all the source code, containers, VM images, IaC scripts, API\n\n#### ***Advantages of using separate tools:***\n\nThe most important one is the *maturity of the tools*.\n\nYou need to consider that Gartner expects this new category to have a high impact, but also predicts that it will take five to ten years before CNAPP is established in regular use.\n\nSince this is a new category of products, the market for CNAPP has just started to evolve and vendors need time to integrate all these capabilities.\n\nCWPP vendors have started to add new features capabilities, including IaC scanning.\n\nSome CSPMs have cutting edge-technology in place and can already give you some of the features promised a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/).\n\nThis is the case of [Cyscale Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com), the solution that offers advanced visibility, but more importantly, gives you context so you can better prioritize.\\\nThe [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/)™ built within the platform may reveal, for example, that one of the resources usually reported to have a high-security risk, is not as vulnerable as it seems. (Let's think about a VM that has unencrypted disks attached, but is not being used in a production environment, or is not externally accessible from the internet).\\\nThis type of approach can make you realize that you need a more advanced risk analysis and a look beyond the classic list of logs, where the vulnerable components are reported without taking into consideration the bigger picture.\n\nRegardless of your choice of tool, just remember to give security posture the importance it deserves.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"CNAPP","seoTitle":"CNAPP Expert Insights and Tips | Cyscale Blog","seoDescription":"Explore the forefront of Cloud-Native Application Protection.
