If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n\n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for GCP. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!

Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud resources, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time."}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
