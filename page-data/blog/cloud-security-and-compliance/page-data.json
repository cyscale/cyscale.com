Following cybersecurity best practices automatically improves your compliance scores, while being compliant with international standards demonstrates that your company is preoccupied with data security and makes efforts to secure its cloud computing environments.\n\nIn this article, we will look at both cloud security best practices and compliance standards to construct a comprehensive view on how to secure cloud environments and prevent the occurrence of vulnerabilities while addressing the most common industry compliance frameworks. \n\n## Cloud security  \n\n### 1. Contextual security \n\nNot often do you see contextual security supporting a security program. However, understanding the consequences of each misconfiguration is an essential step to securing your cloud infrastructure since it can help you prioritize remediation work. \n\nA knowledge graph is the perfect data model to support a contextual security analysis that more accurately indicates risk. Cyscale’s [Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) provides a comprehensive view of your cloud assets and the relations between them.  \n\n[This all-inclusive graph](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/The%20Cyscale%20Security%20Knowledge%20Graph%E2%84%A2%20is%20an%20all-inclusive%20graph%20that%20provides%20correlations%20between%20all%20of%20your%20cloud%20assets,%20as%20well%20as%20other%20apps%20and%20systems%20that%20may%20affect%20cloud%20security%20posture,%20and%20automatically%20pinpoints%20security%20issues.) highlights risk contextually and helps you make better sense of your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/29_blog-knowledge-graph.webp\" alt=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" title=\"The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 2. IAM  \n\nWhen we think of cloud security, the first thing that comes to our mind is Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM is described as a set of rules and policies that establish who can access what resources. Authentication and authorization are the security principles that tackle these issues. \n\nSome key configurations you can make to ensure a strong [IAM policy](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/) are: \n\n* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), \n* Implement The Principle of Least Privilege for access control, \n* Ensure continuous logging and monitoring, \n* Rotate credentials and keys regularly, and others. \n\n### 3. Data encryption \n\nData encryption is necessary to obtain data confidentiality and protect your assets. Data at rest is the most targeted data, and it can be protected through symmetric encryption. You can encrypt: \n\n* Databases, \n* Files, \n* Buckets, and others storage assets. \n\nIn order to perform correct encryption, ensure that you choose the suitable algorithm (for data at rest, AES is an industry-standard), store your cryptographic keys securely and away from data, rotate the keys you use, and follow other best practices described [in this article](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/). \n\nMoreover, encrypt all cloud data traveling to and from your cloud environment using SSL/TLS to prevent any eavesdropping attacks and data breaches.. \n\n## Compliance \n\nIn this article, we will look at some of the most accredited standards: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iso-27001-compliance/), which has been [recently updated](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/), \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/soc-2/), \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/pci-dss/),  \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR. \n\n### ISO 27001  \n\nThis standard was developed by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) and defines security best practices for ISMSs (Information Security Management Systems). It contains 93 security controls that specify rules in the following areas: \n\n* People (8 controls),  \n* Organizational (37 controls),  \n* Technological (34 controls),   \n* Physical (14 controls). \n\nAfter obtaining the accreditation, it has a three-year validity.  \n\nThe newest version of ISO 27001 was released in October 2022. You can find more details [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/). \n\n### SOC 2 \n\nSOC 2 is governed by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It also defines security rules for ISMSs, having 64 criteria that need to be fulfilled by a company to obtain this accreditation. They are grouped into five Trust Service Criteria (TSC): \n\n1. Security, \n2. Availability, \n3. Processing integrity, \n4. Confidentiality, \n5. Privacy. \n\nSOC 2 has a one-year validity. \n\nYou can find a comprehensive comparison between SOC 2 and ISO 27001 [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-vs-ISO-27001-SaaS/). \n\n### PCI-DSS \n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a compliance framework that specifies regulatory compliance requirements regarding credit and debit card transactions performed by a company.  \n\nThis standard regulates credit card information processing, storage, and transmission.  \n\nPCI-DSS contains 12 requirements that ensure a company keeps cardholder data safe. They refer to: \n\n* firewall management,  \n* encryption of sensitive data,  \n* the security of applications and technologies,  \n* the authentication process within a company, and many more. \n\nYou can see the entire list, along with explanations, [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/). \n\n### HIPAA \n\n[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) is the most well-known standard that regulates the management of individuals’ personal health information (PHI). It is a U.S. healthcare federal law that contains three rules regarding the storage, the management, and the access rights to PHI. \n\nThe three rules are: \n\n1. The Privacy Rule, \n2. The Security Rule, \n3. The Breach Notification Rule. \n\nOne aspect of HIPAA is that the consequences of HIPAA violations are not only financial, but also criminal. \n\n### GDPR \n\nGDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) is a security and privacy law drafted and passed by the European Union on May 25, 2018. This law affects anyone that processes EU citizen data, even if they are not from the EU. \n\nSome of the protection principles dictated by [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) are: \n\n* Lawfulness, fairness and transparency, \n* Accountability, \n* Data minimization,  \n* Integrity and confidentiality, and others. \n\nAll of these compliance standards have rigorous regulatory requirements, and the consequences of not implementing those rules can lead to financial and criminal repercussions, as well as a damaged reputation.\n\nTo read more about these compliance standards, as well as NIST, check out our [whitepaper](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/the-complete-guide-to-cloud-compliance/). \n\nUnderstanding **cloud compliance** is crucial for organizations that want to ensure both the security and legality of their cloud operations. The constantly changing landscape of regulations demands a comprehensive approach to compliance, aligning with various standards such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.

From your intellectual property and software services you sell, to sensitive data on customers and users, any threat can put your reputation on the line.  \n\nWhile public cloud resources are key enablers of business, they come with the adoption of a shared responsibility model that makes it difficult to define your security perimeter. This makes securing your apps and data in the cloud a complex and confusing process. But it doesn’t have to be. Good cloud security is achievable for any business, regardless of size, and it shouldn’t take all your time and resources to get it right.  \n\n### Context is king \n\nHow many cloud resources or assets am I running? What even is a cloud resource? My engineers are creating new assets every week, how am I going to keep track of them all? Where does the responsibility of AWS end and mine begin? These are the kind of questions you are going to be faced with, whether cloud security is your full-time job or just part of your responsibility for the overall tech stack.  \n\nFinding answers to these questions and more, will take time and effort because there are no standard responses. Everyone’s cloud infrastructure is different and brings with it unique risks.  \n\nThis is why context is so important. Cybersecurity tools are notorious for creating alert fatigue – an overwhelming number of alerts for every vulnerability, misconfiguration, and new threat out there. Following up on all these alerts as and when they come in, can easily start out as a fool’s errand and frequently become humanly impossible.  \n\nFor example: An unsecured Virtual Machine in isolation may pose no risk but will still trigger an alert. An unsecured VM that has access to a bucket used to store sensitive client data poses a much bigger risk that your company, your customers, and your lawyers will care about.  \n\n**Identify** \n\nBeing able to identify the risks is only one part of the challenge.   \n\n**Prioritize** \n\nUnderstanding the context of the risk to prioritize it is an essential second stage in the process. \n\n**Fix** \n\nThe steps needed to remediate the risk are the third stage in the solution. \n\nBecause there is no one-size-fits-all solution to cloud infrastructure security, any attempt to follow this path will eventually result in frustration due to not feeling in control, and a lack of understanding of the impact of a security issue, which can lead to bigger threats.  \n\n### My cloud provider has its own security tools, can’t I just use them? \n\nAll the big cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer a suite of security tools specific to their products and these are a common choice for cloud native organizations as they can be added on when buying cloud services and are built by the same provider.  \n\nBut these solutions have evolved in line with the sprawling menu of cloud services on offer, and the application of these tools has become granular to the level where some security components and their corresponding configuration are attached to specific products and services, and then again to specific regions and resources.  \n\nThe cloud providers charge for security services in much the same way they do for cloud resources. Not only does this frequently trigger the ‘bill shock’ associated with cloud consumption, because activating a native security solution for a service introduces unpredictability into the pricing, it makes management of your cloud security posture very complex and time consuming.  \n\nThis approach has significant implications for context as well – because information is scattered within the toolset, you are required to make the relevant correlations yourself, resulting in poor overall visibility and blind spots.  \n\nFurthermore, this is just for a single cloud environment. If your organization needs to secure apps or data across multiple clouds, you need to learn a whole other set of security services and tools specific to the cloud environment.  \n\nSo, if you use the AWS supplied toolset, you must go to 1,000 different places to understand all your security settings, let alone how all the security settings relate and connect to one another. And when you go to Azure, it's another 1,000 places that you go to check. \n\nOf course, some companies will become proficient in using the cloud provider’s own security tools, but there is still the associated cost in deployment and the investment into a non-transferrable skill. This can result in cloud security know-how being concentrated within certain people and makes it difficult to understand your broader posture from both a cloud security and compliance perspective.  \n\n### What about the big-name cloud security solutions I read about in a Gartner report? \n\nThere are well-established vendors, like Check Point, that have developed their portfolios over time, and there are relative newcomers to cloud security, like Orca and Wiz, that have picked up big name customers and you would be wise to assess these offerings.  \n\nHowever, most of these solutions are targeted at enterprise customers with big teams and big budgets, and even the analysts note that some of the most comprehensive security solutions are not suitable for smaller organizations due to the investment required in skills, deployment, and management, not to mention the overall cost.  \n\nFor even the most experienced of users, heavyweight solutions can become overwhelming, resulting in a counter-effective approach as users lose control of their security posture.  \n\n### But there are free tools I can use \n\nThe cloud security landscape is very competitive and there are a range of tools available that claim to be completely free. But anyone making security tools for cloud infrastructure knows that cybersecurity is not something you can cut costs on, so these tools will not remain free, except perhaps for the smallest organizations.  \n\nMost of the free tools are limited in scope or capability requiring a paid ‘upgrade’ to unlock. Others are designed to be self-installed at the free level – a challenge in itself – while the as-a-service version comes with a price tag.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for, and solutions that have no investment in their development are unlikely to offer the level of service and support you get from a paid solution. These tools will quickly become frustrating due to a shortfall in features and an overreliance on multiple offerings to achieve an inferior result.  \n\nCyscale itself offers a free trial of the full product with no limitations, as well as onboarding support to ensure you will get the most value out of our solution before you buy.  \n\n### How do I address cloud infrastructure compliance? \n\nEnabled by the agility of cloud computing, many companies launch SaaS products into the market without fully understanding the regulatory climate, then realize they need to show compliance.   \n\nWith an infrastructure that changes on a weekly or even daily basis as engineers spin up new VMs and resources, preparing for an audit can be stressful, especially in regulated environments where you have to check your security posture against frameworks such as CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST, or many others. \n\nFurther challenges can arise in organizations where engineers have adopted a cloud provider’s own security tools, as these products are notoriously difficult to get visibility into whether established policies are being followed in implementations, leaving you blind to security drifts.   \n\nAt the end of the day, compliance should be delivered as a byproduct of good security, and your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) approach should ensure you are able to see compliance with regulatory frameworks and policies without the need to manually correlate reports from multiple applications.  \n\n### Identity, Access, and Entitlements \n\nOne of the biggest challenges when building applications in the cloud is identity, access, and entitlements, sometimes referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM). This refers to all the best practices and rules that must be followed when establishing authentication and authorization for a user to an organization’s systems and applications, because while keeping track of who has access to what sounds simple, it’s something that is really difficult to do in the cloud. \n\nMoreover, access is not restricted to human users; applications and other types of identities also require access to different types of resources.  \n\nOf course, the big cloud providers each have their own unique approach to access management, and this means learning approaches specific to each cloud environment. Some cloud security solutions integrate with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and help you manage identities and access form a central location, improving your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\n### Understanding the cloud infrastructure security landscape \n\n**Glossary** \n\n[CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management) \n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions are designed specifically for cloud environments, using the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers to gather rich data on cloud configuration and workloads. Cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\n[Misconfiguration](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) \n\nAn incorrect configuration of a cloud system that may lead to vulnerabilities. Possible misconfigurations are too many to list but may include making sensitive databases publicly accessible, creating identities with access rights more elevated than required, enabling write access on a resource that should be read only.  \n\n[Vulnerability](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) \n\nA vulnerability is an inherent weakness in a cloud system that means a resource is unable to resist the actions of a threat agent. A vulnerability could be created through a misconfiguration, or series of misconfigurations, but it could also be a newly discovered flaw in a piece of code or software that a resource is dependent on.  \n\nThreat \n\nA cloud threat is a type of attack or adversary looking to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in data breaches, data loss, system hijacking, and a myriad of other internal and external threats.  \n\nResource \n\nA cloud resource, also known as an asset, refers to any one of a number of entities including but not limited to, a virtual machine, a database, or storage bucket. An asset could also refer to VPC, subnet, policy, security key, or IP address. \n\n[CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) \n\nA CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps. A cloud-native application is an application that is designed for, run and hosted in the cloud.  \n\nCIEM \n\nCIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) tools manage identities and access privileges to cloud infrastructure and services. It is often deployed as an umbrella solution that includes Identity and Access Management (IAM). \n\n**Download this guide as a PDF** \n\n<div class=\"hs-cta-embed hs-cta-simple-placeholder hs-cta-embed-136438852760\"\n  style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%; width:210px;height:42.390625px\" data-hubspot-wrapper-cta-id=\"136438852760\">\n  <a href=\"https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKTGbp%2Fo9uY%2B1cpwqxYO%2BVdgBMG2bgcgDZpv3UP7fDM0cPci8FmFfQrFEsURZY%2FBCwYOLNlG1XYE6BnbA1HIeTHNfwLiP2GUGYlTRO8CW82qb9egx0YmY9aQqHwOJa6iekClG%2FMfqEbCu0Dp5wkLzxfl7v4ITdglHTHc9cfvbVS11AWnEbx0NEGVzaWJngIJAT7AL7Hb9Sj8j%2BtDc7O96NDo4C5OsZhIeDO7CXDRRccKrDRsTFtfE9f4VAPVJWvV65oHjHpAVfzD5qX8u%2BU%2FIVvOMducO6AS96ZUM4%3D&webInteractiveContentId=136438852760&portalId=5413427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n    <img alt=\"Download\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5413427/interactive-136438852760.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: fill\"\n      onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\" />\n  </a>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","seoTitle":"Inside the Mind of an Attacker: How Contextual Security Can Save Your Cloud","description":"The future of cloud security is contextual security.

It might seem that a VM is completely secure because you put it behind a firewall, but if a compromised user can access it, it’s game over. \n\nThe perfect recipe for contextual security is a [Cloud Security Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/). Based on it, we can represent in a visual and interactive way how cloud resources interact, what kind of relations they have, what users have permissions to read/write on them, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate my point, I will show you some scenarios where the difference between a secure cloud and a breach is made by fixing misconfigurations and limiting users' access. These measures are easier to identify using a graph, because it helps you understand the risks your environment is exposed to.  \n\n## Case Study \n\nLet’s assume we use BigQuery in Google Cloud for a health analytics application. We have a table that contains some datasets of patients from a hospital, including PII data. These datasets are very valuable and cannot fall in the hands of outsiders. \n\nNow, we want to make sure that the data is securely stored. We look at the BigQuery table’s graph to see if the table poses any risk and, low and behold, it does! \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-graf0.png\" alt=\"Contextual security through the graph\" title=\"Contextual security through the graph\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe can observe, in the image above, that no less than 7 Cloud Functions and 4 VMs can access it across 9 Service Accounts that have permissions on the BigQueryTable, as well as 7 IAM Users. Does this alarm you? It should. \n\nBut just because a VM, or a function, can have access to the table does not mean anything, right? Wrong! I’m going to show you exactly how bad things can get in this situation. I’m going to put my hacker shoes on and show you potential scenarios that might lead to data being stolen. \n\n### Scenario 1: compromised VM \n\nOut of the 4 VMs that we see in the image, one is an Internet-facing one. The compute instance “dev-1” hosts an application that has the Log4J vulnerability, a classic. A hacker leverages the vulnerability and gains access to the instance. If they take over an IAMUser with the Compute Instance Admin role, or obtain SSH access to the VM, the disaster begins. **Because a Service Account is associated to the VM, the attacker has that account’s permissions.** In our scenario, the application running on the Instance needs to process data in the dataset, so the associated Service Account was given the roles/bigquery.dataEditor permission. \n\nMoreover, in a VM, credentials used to manually authenticate are stored on the Compute Instance after the first time a user authenticates as a Service Account, in */.config/gcloud/credentials.db*, as you can see in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss1.png\" alt=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" title=\"Credentials stored in Google Cloud VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThis is a standard location and it stores the last private key that was used to authenticate as a Service Account.  You can also find access tokens in the same folder, in *access_tokens.db*. Moreover, you can see any other private keys used previously (which may still be valid, if they were not deleted in the Google Cloud Console) in */.config/gcloud/legacy_credentials/<serviceAccountEmail>/adc.json*. \n\nLooking at the file credentials.db, we notice that the information is not stored in the standard format for a private key for a Service Account. With a few adjustments, we obtain a valid private key that we then use to authenticate. To authenticate as a Service Account with a private key, simply use the following command:  \n\n```\ngcloud auth activate-service-account <serviceAccountEmail> --key-file=<keyFile>\n```\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss2.png\" alt=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" title=\"Authenticating using the secret key\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nHowever, what happens when no one has authenticated as a Service Account on the VM? There is no *credentials.db* file (actually, there is no *.config* folder).  \n\nDevelopers tend to find ways to do things faster, and they get comfortable. It is not uncommon to find secrets in environment variables or plain-text files. If a developer were to store a secret key file on the Compute Instance, we could abuse it. Simply log in using the private RSA key file: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss3.png\" alt=\"Private key on the VM\" title=\"Private key on the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss4.png\" alt=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" title=\"Authenticating as Service Account\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nChecking the current permissions, and… bingo! roles/bigquery.dataEditor is one of the available roles. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss5.png\" alt=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" title=\"Service Account with roles/bigquery.dataEditor\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf we expand the graph’s nodes that we used in this chain of attacks, you can clearly see the attack path: \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-primul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through the VM\" title=\"Attack path through the VM\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWith the bigquery.dataEditor role, the attacker can now: \n\n* view data and metadata, \n* modify data and metadata, \n* delete tables. \n\n This breach could be avoided by: \n\n* ensuring the VM does not have vulnerabilities, and patching the Log4J one, \n* isolating the Compute Instance from the Internet by closing the exposed port, if possible, \n* restricting the Service Account’s permissions as much as possible,\n* making sure secrets are cleared from the VM files.   \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ss6.png\" alt=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" title=\"Access to the BigQueryTable datasets\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### Scenario 2: compromised user \n\nExpanding the Users node, we see that there are three users that have access to the BigQueryTable.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_54-ultimul-graf.png\" alt=\"Attack path through user compromise\" title=\"Attack path through user compromise\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIf a hacker were to take over any of those accounts, for example, by stealing credentials, our customer’s data would be at risk. If one of the three users that have access to the table does not have MFA enforced, then the attacker can compromise the account.  \n\nEnabling MFA would prevent this. \n\nBesides this, a common mistake is focusing on protecting your environment from the outside, and forgetting about your own users. If one of the employees in the organization has too many permissions, they may produce damage without intention. By exploring the account and looking at resources, a user can accidentally modify or delete an asset. \n\nThis is why the Least Privilege Principle is so important – always limit the users’ access as much as possible and only assign the necessary permissions. \n\nWe believe that context is the future of cloud security. We’ve seen how the most simple relations between assets can be leveraged by attackers to take over cloud assets; and if your customers’ data is stored in those assets, the greater the prize is for hackers – and they will do anything to get it."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Cyber Safety Review Board Rings Alarm Bells for Shared Responsibility in the Cloud","description":"The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) of the Department of Homeland Security is now embarking on its third cyber vulnerability review since the body was created in February 2022.

During August, when lots of people were on summer vacation, a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory was exposed.  \n\nAs with the two vulnerabilities the CSRB reviewed previously - Log4J in July of 2022 and Lapsus$ also in August of 2023 – the Azure Active Directory vulnerability highlights significant challenges in terms of remediation, due to the sprawling nature of cloud resources and their direct and indirect dependencies on assets that might, or might not, be affected.  \n\nEven for large organizations with sizeable security teams, navigating a complex dependency graph to understand which resources have dependencies on affected assets is a challenge. For SaaS startups with perhaps a handful of people building out their technology stack, such investigations are impossible.  \n\nAs a result, the findings of the CSRB’s reports and its recommendations for best practice build a strong case for contextually aware cloud security practices.  \n\n## How does this affect you (and everyone else)? \n\nIn its most recent announcement, the CSRB made it clear that identity access management (IAM) and authentication are in focus due to being one of the most vulnerable areas in a cloud environment. Identity management vulnerabilities are a key entry point for hackers, and SaaS companies and large enterprises are falling victim repeatedly. From IAM misconfigurations that CTOs and developers miss when setting up and managing their environment, to cloud service provider bugs, this area needs critical attention to ensure safe and secure cloud environments. \n\n## Did I just say cloud service provider bugs?  \n\nYes, I did. The incident in question that kicked off this latest review less than two months ago, was the discovery of a critical vulnerability in the authentication process for Azure Active Directory (soon to be renamed Microsoft Entra ID) that was allowing hackers to fabricate authentication tokens. Around 25 organizations including US government entities were impacted by this bug before it was discovered, with attackers stealing mailbox data and obtaining access to sensitive emails.  \n\nFor cloud native organizations building their entire business on public cloud platforms, this shared responsibility model is one of the most misunderstood (or ignored) aspects.  \n\nWhen the terms & conditions say that the cloud is a ‘shared responsibility’, it really is. It’s the cloud service provider’s job to secure the platform or infrastructure, and your job to secure the apps and data, and if one party fails (in this case, the cloud service provider – Microsoft Azure), your company, and potentially your customers and partners, are left exposed. \n\nThe CSRB’s previous two reports on [Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/csrb-log4j-key-findings-and-recommendations-summary) and [Lapsus$](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/review-attacks-associated-lapsus-and-related-threat-groups-executive-summary) have been very thorough and made some great recommendations that we hope will advance cybersecurity practices, which is why we’re eagerly waiting for CSRB’s report on cloud security. It not only promises a thorough set of recommendations for CISOs, CTOs, and developers, but it will also sound the alarm for cloud service providers.  \n\nAlthough the Cyber Safety Review Board has no regulatory power, its findings are transmitted to US President Biden and used to develop Executive Orders, so we can expect to see its influence in regulations such as [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), and perhaps best practices adopted into SOC 2, ISO 27001, and others. \n\n## The importance of contextual security \n\nWhat’s become evident is that simply informing businesses and cloud providers of the discovery of far-reaching misconfigurations and vulnerabilities is not enough. In fact, the potential workload created by responding to these challenges can be just as dangerous in that it can consume all an organization’s security resources.  \n\nContext is important and [contextual security](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) is the most significant development in cloud infrastructure security in recent years. Identifying that a VM has the Log4J vulnerability is not the same as saying that an Internet-facing VM has the same vulnerability. Of course, they are both just as vulnerable, but if the first VM is running in a private network, the severity is not as high as for the one accessible from the Internet. The risk is not the same, but the alert will be, and we all know alert fatigue is a very real problem.  \n\nWrong prioritization, or no prioritization at all, can make all the difference between a secure cloud environment and a breach."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["News"],"title":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","seoTitle":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","description":"Explore how AWS's new IPv4 billing changes, effective from February 2024, will influence both your financial and security strategies.

Whether you are a seasoned cloud engineer or a business decision-maker this shift by one of the world's leading cloud providers will likely have broad implications.\n\nAWS's decision aligns with other major cloud providers that have adopted similar practices, reflecting an industry-wide trend. AWS's involvement is particularly significant given its substantial market presence, and it will likely influence various organizations across different scales and industries.\n\nIn terms of your business and the tech landscape, this change goes beyond additional costs, with the new model affecting network planning, igniting considerations about transitioning to IPv6, and opening opportunities to reassess cloud security strategies.\n\n## The Financial Implications of AWS's New Charging Model for IPv4 Addresses\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Pricing\n\nStarting February 1, 2024, AWS will charge for all public IPv4 addresses at a rate of 0.5 cents per hour. While this figure may initially seem inconsequential, it is vital to understand how swiftly it can accumulate. \n\nFor small businesses or individual projects, the impact might be marginal. Our example considers a small organization with 10 public IP addresses:\n\n*10 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $36.5 per month, or $438 per year.*\n\nContrast this with an enterprise operating with 11,000 public IPs: \n\n*11,000 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $40,150 per month, or nearly **$500,000 per year**.*\n\n1﻿1,000 IP addresses might sound like an overestimation, but we are seeing organizations with tens of thousands of EC2 instances. Assuming 20-30% of these need public IPs is not out of reach.\n\nThis striking difference highlights the importance of understanding and planning for the financial consequences, particularly for organizations heavily reliant on public IPv4 addresses.\n\n### Budget Considerations for Organizations\n\nAWS's decision to charge for public IPv4 addresses extends beyond a simple financial concern; it prompts businesses to reevaluate their entire approach to IP address utilization. Key considerations include:\n\n* **Reviewing existing usage:** Analyzing current usage patterns is essential for predicting additional costs and identifying opportunities for optimization.\n* **Considering IPv6 migration:** Some may find transitioning to IPv6 a cost-effective alternative, though it must be balanced against compatibility and technical constraints.\n* **Utilizing tools and insights:** Automated security platforms like Cyscale can offer comprehensive insights into your inventory of public IP addresses, helping you understand the big picture and delivering insight that can aid in cost control.\n\nThis policy change serves as a catalyst for reimagining how organizations approach cloud infrastructure financially. The ripple effects will be felt differently across the spectrum, but the core message is clear: understanding, planning, and adapting will be pivotal in navigating this change without unforeseen financial setbacks.\n\nWhether you are a decision-maker concerned about the bottom line or a cloud professional tasked with optimization, these changes necessitate close scrutiny and proactive planning.\n\n## Technical Aspects and Considerations\n\n### Impact on EC2 Instances, RDS, EKS, etc.\n\nThe new charging model impacts a broad array of resources, including EC2 instances, RDS, EKS, load balancers, and more. Managing complex architectures now entails a new layer of complexity, possibly requiring a reassessment of networking strategies and configurations.\n\n### The Complexity of Managing Multiple IP Addresses per Resource\n\nSome resources may have more than one public IPv4 address. Managing these involves not just technical configuration but also financial planning. Understanding how these multiple IPs interact within your infrastructure and contribute to overall costs is essential. \n\n### Discussion on the Feasibility and Challenges of Switching to IPv6\n\nThe move to IPv6 seems logical, but it's not devoid of challenges. Compatibility with services and APIs managed by others might become a hurdle. AWS has made progress, such as enabling communication from EC2 to Lambda functions over IPv6 (note that you cannot reach an EC2 instance from Lambda over IPv6), yet some cases may still hinder a complete switch.\n\n### IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms\n\nDuring the transition, Network Address Translation (NAT), specifically NAT64, becomes vital. This mechanism translates IPv6 to IPv4 addresses, bridging communication between newer IPv6 systems and legacy IPv4 systems. Understanding and utilizing NAT64 is crucial for modernizing without losing functionality. Equally important is DNS64 which performs the translation at the DNS level. More specifically, in the case a domain is mapped only to an IPv4 address (i.e., it only has A records), DNS64 translates an A record (specific to IPv4) to an AAAA record (specific to IPv6), thus allowing an IPv6 client to reach an IPv4 server.\n\n### Proficiency with Security Groups and Other Network Considerations\n\nWith all IPv6 addresses being public, mastering security groups and leveraging egress-only internet gateways become even more critical. Properly configuring security rules and comprehending their interaction with different IP versions plays a significant role in upholding security and functionality within your network.\n\nThe new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a financial consideration. It intertwines with a multifaceted web of technical aspects that must be thoughtfully navigated. Embracing the right strategies and tools can pave the way for a seamless transition, preserving both efficiency and budget.\n\n## Security Implications\n\n### Reevaluation of Network Exposure\n\nThe new charges for public IPv4 addresses might encourage organizations to scrutinize network exposure more closely. Reducing the number of public IPs could be both a cost-saving measure and a strategy to enhance security by limiting the **attack surface.**\n\n### Importance of Secure Configuration in IPv6 Transition\n\nTransitioning to IPv6, while potentially cost-effective, demands careful consideration of security configurations. Understanding IPv6 security nuances is vital in safeguarding systems during and after the shift. While NAT64 facilitates communication between IPv6 and IPv4 systems, it also introduces unique security considerations. Proper implementation and continuous vigilance are required to ward off vulnerabilities that might arise during the translation process. In practice, most organizations will leverage the AWS NAT Gateway which already supports NAT64 and DNS64 (through Route 53) so our responsibility includes proper route configuration and keeping DNS resolvers up to date. However, other organizations might choose to deploy their own NAT instance to optimize cost.\n\n### Tools and Platforms for Security Management\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale can play a pivotal role in this secure transition. By providing insights into all public IP addresses, their attachments, and alternative communication paths, they can facilitate a more secure and cost-effective migration. Utilizing specialized security platforms and tools is fundamental to maintaining control over complex cloud environments.\n\nThis new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a technical and financial hurdle; it's an opportunity to rethink and potentially enhance security strategies. By understanding the interplay between IPv4 and IPv6, the role of the transition mechanisms, and the necessity of proper security configurations, organizations can navigate this transition without compromising security.\n\n## The Role of Cloud Security Platforms\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale are more than just a reactive measure to changes like AWS's new charging model for public IPv4 addresses; they represent a proactive approach to modern cloud infrastructure management. By providing tools that cut across cost optimization, security enhancement, migration planning, and collaboration, these holistic solutions enable organizations to thrive in an evolving cloud landscape."}}],"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3058837307","3765828210","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
