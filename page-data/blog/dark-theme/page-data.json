Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.png\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif-for-alerts.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance","News"],"title":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","description":"DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) is a compliance standard destined for financial institutions that regulates operational risk management.

This means that **financial companies have less than 2 years left to become compliant with DORA** and successfully manage operational risk. \n\nThe usage of cloud computing is witnessing a steady rise in 2023, and the financial sector is embracing this trend with open arms. \n\nTo understand DORA and its implication for cloud infrastructures in financial companies, let's look at the requirements and how an organization can become compliant with it. \n\n## Structure \n\nDORA has nine chapters that include general provisions, ICT risk management, digital operational resilience testing, and others.  \n\nThe chapter that contains technical requirements that apply to cloud environments is the second one, **ICT risk management**. In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* \n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\n \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA. Kickstart your compliance journey with us now and ensure a smooth process for DORA compliance. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","seoTitle":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","description":"CNAPP is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications.

A [cloud-native application](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) is an application that is intended for cloud, ran and hosted in the cloud. \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:  \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management),  \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management), and \n* Containers Security. \n\nIn this article, we will understand what features a CNAPP has, and why it is a necessary tool for protecting cloud-native applications. \n\n## Why is CNAPP needed?  \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture than non-native applications, it is essential to understand the key features cloud-native applications have and the security concerns that come with them. \n\n**How is the infrastructure different?** Cloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes, which can increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but can also introduce new concerns in terms of security.  \n\nThese types of applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs. \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP solution is necessary to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.  \n\nLet’s understand some of the features CNAPP solutions provide to secure cloud-native applications. \n\n### 1. Visibility\n\nContext-aware visibility is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Because of the complex nature of cloud-native applications, it can become challenging to understand issues regarding the underlying infrastructure. Visibility is ensured in CSPM platforms. \n\nFor example, even though microservices communicate with each other and the application is functioning correctly, vulnerabilities may still exist. A misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access.  \n\nTherefore, visibility features in CNAPP are important to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between cloud assets, applications and systems and automatically pinpoints security issues. [The graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities and provide visibility in your cloud environment. \n\n### 2. Security controls\n\nManually going through every cloud asset and configuration to check for vulnerabilities is not only a difficult task, but it can also become impossible in large cloud environments in which thousands of assets are in use.  \n\nTo solve this problem, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and provide guidance for remediating found issues. This mechanism saves time and reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP. \n\nFor example, you can see a control from the Cyscale platform in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-1-control.png\" alt=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIn Cyscale, you can find a collection of over 300 controls that check services across multiple cloud vendors and provide remediation steps for findings. \n\nWhen an asset does not pass a control, an alert is generated.  \n\nTargeted alerts that highlight vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a cloud environment are crucial; reacting to and fixing findings quickly can save a company from a breach. \n\nHowever, alert fatigue is a real problem that security teams deal with; receiving too many alerts can lead to security professionals ignoring important alerts. A good CNAPP solution deals with all of these problems and provides a sound alert system.  \n\nFor example, in the image below, you can see an alert that has been triggered. Alerts can be Open or Resolved, to indicate if the issue that generated the alert has been fixed. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-2-alert.png\" alt=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 3. Data security \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications, data security is a critical concern in companies administering them. By scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be exposed. \n\nUsing a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/), data security can be achieved for cloud-native applications. Security controls, as discussed in the previous section, enable organizations to identify misconfigurations or non-compliance with data security best practices in their cloud assets. \n\nIt is recommended that: \n\n* [At rest and in transit data are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/),  \n* Assets are not publicly accessible unless it is necessary, \n* Encryption keys are managed correctly in their entire lifecycle, and others. \n\nFor each of these best practices and more, Cyscale offers a wide variety of controls that cover AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies*, \n* *Ensure databases are not publicly accessible*, \n* *Ensure that Encryption key is rotated*. \n\nMoreover, in Cyscale, you can find a [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and encryption keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities. \n\n### 4. Compliance \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their [compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/) journey. The CSPM ([Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/)) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet various compliance frameworks.  \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to prepare for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards are: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR, \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/). \n\nCyscale supports all of them and more. You can view all supported standards on the Standards page, enable or disable frameworks, track progress with your compliance process, and view the cloud-focused requirements and associated controls for each of the standards.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-3-compliance.png\" alt=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:0.0625rem;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 5. Container image scanning  \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.  \n\nFor example, if a container image uses **an unpatched version of Log4J**, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications running in that container. \n\n### 6. Cloud workloads protection \n\nCWPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/) and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them. \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes: \n\n* VMs,  \n* Containers,  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### 7. Kubernetes Cluster inspection \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It contains the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining, for example, which application is running in which container. \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior. \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are: \n\n* Unauthorized access,  \n* Missing patches,  \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### 8. IAM\n\n[IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) is another essential component of cloud-native applications security, specific to a CIEM platform. With complex cloud environments, it can become challenging to keep track of users, their different access levels, what impact certain permissions have, and so on. \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to the following aspects, but not limited to: \n\n1. Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making it more difficult to manage IAM. \n2. Cloud-native software is built to run in cloud environments, in multi-cloud as well as on-premises. \n3. The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing IAM identities at the service level. \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to secure their cloud in terms of IAM and manage identities.  \n\nSome best practices regarding IAM are: \n\n* **Implement multi-factor authentication for all users.** This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification. \n* **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity. \n* **Comply with the Least Privilege Principle** to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary. \n* **Assign permissions at group level** and assign very well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches. \n\nYou can read more about securing IAM in the cloud [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nTo ensure a deep understanding of user permissions and their impact, Cyscale provides an [Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-4-iam.png\" alt=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to their dynamic nature, their high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient. \n\nCNAPP solutions offer: \n\n* Visibility, \n* Compliance, \n* Data security, \n* Runtime protection, \n* Container image scanning, \n* Kubernetes cluster inspection, \n* IAM, and others. \n\nUse Cyscale to benefit from these features and secure your cloud environment! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","description":"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Technology Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines is a set of principles and best practices destined for financial institutions, meant to regulate risk management and assessment, access control, incident management, software application development, and others.

Technology Risk Governance and Oversight \n2. Technology Risk Management Framework \n3. IT Project Management and Security-by-Design \n4. Software Application Development and Management \n5. IT Service Management \n6. IT Resilience \n7. Access Control \n8. Cryptography \n9. Data and Infrastructure Security \n10. Cyber Security Operations \n11. Cyber Security Assessment \n12. Online Financial Services \n13. IT Audit \n\nThese sections contain subsections that describe in detail the best practices that should be followed for each area covered by that section.  \n\nIt is important to note that MAS TRM Guidelines does not contain any specific controls, and it is up to the organization to create and tailor controls to fulfill each section's recommendations. \n\nIn this article, we will look in detail at the sections that may apply for cloud environments and understand the requirements. \n\n## IT Resilience  \n\nThis section describes the importance of: \n\n* Availability,  \n* Recoverability, \n* Disaster recovery, \n* Backups,  \n* Data centre resilience. \n\n**Availability** ensures users can access data without interruption. High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 268 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\n<img src=\"/img/33_blog-mas-standard.png\" alt=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
