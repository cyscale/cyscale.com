It usually stores sensitive information that should be well protected.  \n\nWhen we’re discussing databases in the cloud, there are two options for users. They can: \n\n* manage their own database in the cloud, or \n* use a service provided by their cloud vendor. \n\nThe latter is usually the easier choice since the cloud vendor takes care of security features.  \n\nHowever, your database may be vulnerable in both cases if you don’t configure your environment correctly. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for securing databases in the cloud and how to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that may exist or appear in the future. \n\n## Best practices \n\n### 1. Filter inbound and outbound traffic. \n\nManaging traffic to and from the database is the first layer of database protection. Place databases behind firewalls and restrict the traffic allowed to reach them as much as possible. \n\nYou can implement more granular rules by only allowing a list of known IPs to connect to a database (for example, the range of addresses specific to a known data center), or by filtering traffic based on other criteria. \n\nMoreover, you can apply conditional access for users when administering the database. You can ask for additional security checks like Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure the entities managing the database are legitimate. \n\n### 2. Ensure availability through redundancy \n\nWhen deploying a database in the public cloud, you have the option to ensure availability through redundancy. You can replicate a database in different data centers and even different geographical regions. \n\nIf one data center or region fails, you can rely on a replication of the database located in a different data center to work. \n\n### 3. Encrypt your database \n\nDatabase [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) is important for protecting your data at rest.  \n\nEnsure that only authorized entities can see the data you’re storing in the database by [encrypting it ](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/)with a strong, recommended algorithm such as AES-256. Keep your encryption keys safe by storing them separately from the data, use strong generation algorithms and rotate them every 90 days or less. \n\n### 4. Secure your database connection \n\nNot only data at rest is vulnerable. When you're transferring data to and from the database, it is essential to encrypt your traffic.  \n\nThis is called encryption for data in transit and is implemented with the TLS/SSL protocols. \n\n### 5. Keep your connection details secret \n\nDo not disclose database connection strings, keys, certificates, and other secrets that may be used to breach your database. You can use cloud solutions to keep your cryptographic secrets safe: \n\n* [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) Key Vault, \n* [AWS ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/)Key Management Service (AWS KMS), \n* [Google Cloud ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/)Secret Manager, \n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), and others. \n\n### 6. Log connection attempts \n\nKeep track of who is trying to connect to your database by logging any authentication attempts. In this way, you can see if: \n\n* someone unauthorized is trying to or is connecting to the database, \n* there is a brute-force attack taking place.  \n\n### 7. Perform regular database backups \n\nDatabases should be backed up regularly, to prevent loss of data, in the case of: \n\n* Data corruption, and \n* Ransomware attacks. \n\nAlthough ransomware attacks are less common in cloud environments at the moment, attackers could in time develop the proper tactics. \n\n![RPO and RTO](/img/20_blog-rpo-and-rto.webp#shadow \"RPO and RTO\")\n\nThe time between the backups is known as RPO (Recovery Point Objective). It is measured as the time that passed between the last backup and the current one. If a disaster appears, the data written in that time is lost. \n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the time it takes for an application to go back online after a disaster and to restore its data.   \n\nRTO and RPO should be kept in acceptable limits. \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to ensure you’re implementing all the best practices we mentioned in this article. [Cyscale ](https://cyscale.com/)has over 400 controls that can help you secure your entire cloud environment. \n\nHere are some examples of controls that check for any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities regarding your database setup in the public cloud: \n\n* *Ensure encrypted storage is used for VMs that might host a database* for AWS \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances require all incoming connections to use SSL* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database* for Alibaba Cloud \n\nAlong with these controls that alert you on any findings, you receive remediation steps to quickly eliminate any vulnerabilities and secure your database in the cloud. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Everything to Know about HITRUST Compliance in the Cloud","description":"HITRUST (Health Information Trust) Alliance is the organization that established the HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework), a framework for managing and securing information in the healthcare industry.

This comprehensive framework regulates how healthcare providers and other health businesses handle sensitive data, store it and protect it. \n\nThe HITRUST framework goes above and beyond [what HIPAA requires](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) and while its stringency can make it daunting to implement, the benefits of this certification in terms of credibility and assurance are not to be underestimated. \n\nHITRUST CSF is based on ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 and incorporates more than 50 regulations, standards, and frameworks, thus providing a complete set of requirements and best practices to ensure security. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the requirements that apply specifically to healthtech companies with apps and data in the cloud and how to ensure your security and compliance processes are robust enough to pass HITRUST certification. \n\n## HITRUST control categories and how they relate to cloud security \n\nThe standard contains 14 control categories, numbered from 0 to 13: \n\n1. Information Security Management Program \n2. Access control \n3. Human Resources Security \n4. Risk Management \n5. Security Policy \n6. Organization of Information Security \n7. Compliance \n8. Asset Management \n9. Physical and Environmental Security \n10. Communications and Operations Management \n11. Information Systems, Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance \n12. Information Security Incident Management \n13. Business Continuity Management \n14. Privacy Practices \n\nEach control category has one or more objectives, which define the purpose or scope of its requirements, and each Objective contains control references, which encompass a best practice or requirement. There are 49 objectives and 156 control references.  \n\nThis standard can become overwhelming, especially when looking at the 516 pages of version 11.2.0 (the latest one as of November 2023), making implementation a daunting task for small or inexperienced teams. But as we said, the benefits in terms of credibility and increased confidence from your customers cannot be underplayed. Furthermore, there are solutions out there that can do the heavy lifting, such as [ensuring your cloud security controls are in compliance with the framework](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) and alerting you if drifts are detected.  \n\n## Access control for the cloud under HITRUST CSF \n\nThe \"Access control\" category includes recommendations on user management, password policies, [the Least Privilege principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), network segregation, session timeout, teleworking, and many others—everything related to [authentication and authorization](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\n### Effective cloud user password management \n\nImplementing a robust password policy is very important. Imposing a minimum number of characters, as well as the usage of special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and other conditions, is imperative because users tend to want to choose passwords that are easy to remember and type, which increases the risk of having credentials stolen through brute force. Moreover, users should be prohibited from using the same password twice and having old passwords in use. \n\nHow do you implement an effective password policy in the cloud? \n\nTo ensure users implement secure passwords, use the following checklist: \n\n* a minimum length of 14 characters, \n* no password reuse for 24 months, \n* at least a lowercase character, \n* at least an uppercase character, \n* at least a digit, \n* at least one symbol. \n\nAlthough this seems like a lot to consider, it only takes a few minutes to make a great password policy, and for AWS, for example, you can do this in one quick command:  \n\n```\n\naws iam update-account-password-policy --minimum-password-length 14 --password-reuse-prevention 24 --require-lowercase-characters --require-uppercase-characters --require-numbers --require-symbols\n```\n\n### Network Routing Control for cloud infrastructure \n\nRouting controls should be in place to prevent unnecessary connections and information flows across your cloud infrastucture, according to [HITRUST CSF](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/). \n\nFirewalls can block unwanted traffic to your cloud, and we recommend filtering traffic by allowlisting IP addresses and ports to reduce the attack surface and further control the access. [CSPM tools such as Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management//) provide a wide range of security controls that granularly verify that firewall rules are written for the most important ports, such as databases. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-network-controls.png\" alt=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" title=\"Network Routing Controls in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Securing Human Resources in the cloud  \n\nThe next category is “Human resources” and focuses on security and compliance processes that apply during the entire lifecycle of an employee in a company, starting from “Prior to Employment”, through “During On-Boarding”, “During Employment”, all the way up to “Termination or Change of Employment”. Appropriate application of policies and procedures should ensure that every employee is set up with relevant levels of entitlement and privilege to cloud systems and infrastructure, and that those entitlements and access are revoked when the employee leaves.  \n\nPoor access management processes can result in overprivileged users that unnecessarily expand your attack surface.  \n\n### Cloud Roles and Responsibilities \n\nUnder “Prior to Employment”, the first requirement is “Roles and Responsibilities”. \n\nThere should be a clear definition of roles according to the existing information security policy. This umbrella covers the protection of data by allowing only authorized access. We have a complete guide on [best practices for IAM in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nWe’ve put our recommendations into a checklist: \n\n* enable MFA for all users, \n* grant users access to resources, services, and data at group level. You can either directly assign the user permissions or add the user to a group and assign permissions at group level. The second one is recommended because you simplify access management. \n* comply with the Least Privilege principle to only assign the necessary permissions for the required amount of time, and others. \n\n## Compliance controls for cloud assets \n\nJumping to the sixth control category, “Compliance”, there are several technical requirements relevant to cloud infrastructure in the healthcare sector. \n\n### Data Protection in the cloud and Privacy of Covered Information \n\nTo ensure the confidentiality of data, encryption should be enabled for cloud assets that contain sensitive information. This section of the HITRUST standard refers to how encryption should be applied. Here is a [comprehensive guide on data encryption in all its states](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) - data in use, data in motion, and data at rest.  \n\n### Regulation of Cryptographic Controls \n\nEncrypting data is only effective if the used cryptographic algorithms are industry-recommended. For example, if a vulnerable version of SSL/TLS is deployed, data in transit is unprotected. TLS 1.2 is recommended for securely transporting data. \n\nFor [encryption of data at rest](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits) is the standard. \n\n## Protecting your cloud environment and your code \n\nThe 9th control category, “Communications and Operations Management\" in HITRUST CSF covers segregation of duties, change management, malicious code, back-ups, and many other controls. These are most relevant to cloud security: \n\n### Effective change management in the cloud \n\nTo ensure [comprehensive change management in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-posture-management-cspm-guide/), log and monitor all users' actions. This helps you identify and control changes that occur in the cloud environment. To configure a comprehensive change management process, consider logging changes to: \n\n* firewall rules, \n* IAM policies, \n* routing tables, \n* network gateways, \n* VPCs, \n* SQL instances, and others. \n\n### Controls against malicious code in the cloud \n\nThere are a number of things you can do to protect your cloud apps and data against malware. Scan your VMs for malicious programs and make sure their configurations are secure. In Google Cloud, you can deploy your VMs in a hardened state by enabling the “[Shielded VM](https://cyscale.com/blog/securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm/)\" option to prevent malicious code, such as rootkits and backdoors, from infiltrating your cloud environment. \n\nTurning on Shielded VM in Google Cloud takes just a few clicks. Navigate to the VMs' \"Security\" configurations and tick all boxes under this feature.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-shieldedvm.png\" alt=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" title=\"Enabling Shielded VM in Google Cloud\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Cloud back-ups best practices \n\nThe “Back-up” category not only recommends performing regular back-ups, but also having recovery procedures in place for highly sensitive cloud resources, such as key vaults.   \n\nMake [cloud data back-ups](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) and store them separately from the original cloud environment; you can store them in different data centers and regions and use availability zones to ensure that if an unforeseen event occurs at one datacenter, you can still restore a back-up with little to no delay.  \n\nMoreover, enable soft delete for resources that allow this to make sure you’re not deleting a cloud asset that you didn’t mean to delete. For example, Azure Key Vault has soft delete, as well as purge protection. Soft delete allows you to restore the key vault after deletion for a period set by you (between 7 and 90 days), while purge protection will not allow you to purge the key vault (delete forever) manually. You can enable both of these settings quickly with the following command:  \n\n```\n\naz resource update --id <resourceID> --set properties.enablePurgeProtection=true properties.enableSoftDelete=true\n```\n\n### Audit Logging, Monitoring System Use, Protection of Log Information, Administrator and Operator Logs in the cloud \n\nThere are so many control references for logging it can get a bit overwhelming, so let’s break this section apart to make it more manageable. \n\nAudit Logging and Monitoring System Use are quite similar. The first requires you to log user activity and security events, while the latter refers to information processing systems.  \n\nProtection of Log Information recommends that logs are protected from tampering or unauthorized access. Consider securing the bucket or storage account where logs are collected; it is easy for companies to forget to secure logging storage assets because they’re more focused on the sensitive data, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare. \n\nAdministrator and Operator Logs require that high-privilege actions should be logged. For example, the usage of the “root” account in AWS should be logged in order to keep track of who accesses it and why. \n\n## Automating cloud security and HITRUST compliance  \n\nHITRUST CSF is a very complex and detailed compliance standard that can be overwhelming to understand and daunting to implement. What we have covered in this article may only scratch the surface but should serve as a solid foundation on your journey to bringing your cloud compliance in alignment with the framework.  \n\nTo make the overall process more manageable, consider a solution such as the [Cyscale cloud securty platform](https://cyscale.com/) to keep track of your progress, monitor for drifts, and automate security checks that validate your efforts toward achieving HITRUST compliance. Cyscale has over 300 controls that verify your cloud settings against the HITRUST CSF standard and features easily exportable reports to better illustrate your efforts to an auditor, speeding your journey to accreditation. \n\n<img src=\"/img/58_blog-standard-in-cyscale.png\" alt=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" title=\"HITRUST in Cyscale\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"High-severity Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","seoTitle":"Critical NGINX Ingress Vulnerabilities Put Kubernetes Secrets at Risk","description":"Three high-severity security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the NGINX Ingress controller for Kubernetes, which could put credentials and other secrets at risk of theft by threat actors.

These vulnerabilities have been assigned a CVSS score of 7.6 (the first two) and 8.6 (the third one), ranked HIGH. \n\nTo better understand how the vulnerabilities can be exploited, what the impact is on your cloud infrastructure and how they can be patched, let’s dive deeper: \n\n### What is an NGINX Ingress controller? \n\nThe ingress-NGINX controller is a [specialized load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) for Kubernetes and other containerized environments that accepts incoming traffic and routes it to Kubernetes pods. The NGINX Ingress controller is designed to be a central point of entry into a Kubernetes cluster adding a layer of abstraction to reduce routing complexity.  \n\nTo put it simply, it’s like a traffic policeman that tells all vehicles on a road where they are and are not allowed to go. \n\nAn ingress-NGINX controller is a specific implementation of an Ingress controller that uses the NGINX web server, which is known for its speed and efficiency.   \n\n### The 3 NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities in detail \n\n**CVE-2023-5043** \n\nAnnotations are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects in order to add additional information to those objects. \n\nDue to poor input sanitization, the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet can be used to inject command execution. \n\nThe “configuration-snippet” annotation, or metadata, allows users to inject custom configuration code into the NGINX configuration file. \n\n**CVE-2023-5044** \n\nThis vulnerability occurs for the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation. This annotation allows you to establish a permanent HTTP redirect (Return Code 301) by injecting arbitrary code via the annotation. As a result, the controller will redirect traffic to that path. \n\n**CVE-2022-4886** \n\nThis issue can be exploited by someone with create or update permissions on ingress API objects.   \n\nThe field spec.rules\\[].http.paths\\[].path allows you to specify where incoming requests to your applications should be routed based on the path in the URL. Since the input is not correctly sanitized, the attacker can specify an internal file as the path, obtaining the credentials of the controller. Thus, by exploiting the poor sanitization, the attacker gains access to sensitive data. \n\n### Impact of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nIngress controllers run with high privileges. By default, having access to the credentials of the ingress controller means you have access to all secrets in the cluster. As you can imagine, the impact of these vulnerabilities left unchecked can create significant risk for your data. So, it’s no surprise that the vulnerabilities described have been assigned such high CVSS scores.  \n\n### Mitigation of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nTo protect your cloud environment from these vulnerabilities, follow these steps: \n\n* for CVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044, update NGINX to version 1.19 and set the --enable-annotation-validation flag, \n* for CVE-2022-4886, change the pathType attribute of the controller to Exact or Prefix. This will allow only paths that start with “/” and contain alphanumeric characters, “-“, “_”, and additional “/”.  \n\n### The impact of NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities on cloud environments  \n\nThe next question is, are cloud environments impacted by these vulnerabilities? Yes! Many cloud environments run Kubernetes clusters with NGINX-ingress controllers. For a cloud-native company building software that heavily relies on Kubernetes and employs ingress-controllers, there are significant risks involved. If exploited, these bugs can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the cluster. \n\nMoreover, the ingress controller manages incoming traffic, so the disruption of such a critical component of an infrastructure can cause availability issues leading to downtime and possible financial losses. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) surfaces assets affected by the NGINX Ingress controller bugs as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant: Making Cloud Security More Intuitive","seoTitle":"Introducing Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant | Cyscale","description":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","seoDescription":"Cyscale gives a first glimpse into our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.","date":"2023-11-02T13:00:05.768Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"introducing-ai-powered-security-assistant","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/blog-cover-ai-assistant.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/41be8/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/c78f7/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/2c0f5/blog-cover-ai-assistant.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/913d0/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 205w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/91660/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 410w,\n/static/a702904afb59be1adc03b3fb1db7bb09/888e2/blog-cover-ai-assistant.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Cyscale, [the platform for securing your cloud quickly and easily,](https://cyscale.com/) is excited to give a first glimpse into the potential enabled by generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM),  unveiling our AI-powered Security Assistant, which makes cloud security as intuitive as asking a question. \n\nAs engineers we’ve spent almost 20 years working with the cloud, and the complexity of cloud environments mean it’s now impossible to correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually to expose real risk, especially if you have a small team.  \n\nGenerating security alerts is not the problem. The problem is understanding them in context, and it's getting harder for a CTO or CISO to [prioritize remediation because of the volume of alerts](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/).   \n\nWe think context is king, and the value of Cyscale is in our application of graph technology to inventory all cloud assets and the relationships between those assets to [identify and prioritize real security threats](https://cyscale.com/blog/contextual-security-google-cloud/).   \n\nNow with developments in AI we are taking this value even further by enabling our platform to automatically respond to queries and surface uncovered issues using our customers’ cloud footprint combined with Large Language Models (LLM) of vulnerabilities and exploits.    \n\nIn our first look at Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant you can see how we’re making cloud security as intuitive as asking a question.  \n\n## D﻿emonstration of Cyscale’s AI-powered Security Assistant\n <br class=\"\" />\n \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/boWgsssdTDI?si=0IfNfAnUTRMWpvf8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe key value here is the democratization of cloud security. Regardless of your skill level, the Security Assistant connects all the dots between disparate information sources so you don’t have to. This means security practitioners struggling to keep up with technical tasks can get information that’s relevant to them, just the same as compliance officers can get information about security posture through a lens that’s more relevant to their interests.  \n\nThis example shows you just the very tip of what’s possible by asking the Assistant questions such as:  \n\n* Which security controls have failed?   \n* What are my top three vulnerabilities and their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score?  \n* How can I fix these vulnerabilities on their specific cloud platform?   \n\n## Democratizing cloud security with AI\n\nNot only does this approach help people in different functions (security, DevOps, compliance) get information that’s more contextually relevant to their role, it helps them perform tasks faster by giving links directly to the affected assets in question, and clear instructions on how to fix associated issues.   \n\nIt also helps security professionals navigate multi-cloud environments by abstracting the unique and different terminologies used from one cloud provider to another (‘termination’ versus ‘deallocation’ for example) into more natural language. \n\n> “Cybersecurity may have become cloud security, but it’s becoming less and less human friendly,” says Ovidiu Cical, Cyscale CEO. “It’s now impossible for a CTO, CISO, or security practitioner to stay on top of an endless list of alerts and things that need fixing without automation. Companies like us have made great strides in automating these processes and providing context but it’s still a lot of information for small teams to digest and act on.” \n>\n> “With these rapid developments in AI assistance we can help different kinds of people interact with our tools in a more natural and contextually relevant way. AI is actually making cloud security more human,” Ovidiu adds.   \n\nThis is important because [Gartner estimates that 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-the-cloud-secure), mainly through failures to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. Automation puts people back in control by helping them better manage cloud complexity, security, and compliance. \n\nCyscale’s Security Assistant is still in development, so stay tuned for more insights into the potential unlocked by AI, but existing customers and new prospects can request to have it added to their account for testing.  \n\n[B﻿ook a demo to see](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) it in action.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","seoTitle":"SEC Charges SolarWinds CISO with Fraud over Cybersecurity Failures","description":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures due to failure to disclose significant cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities over at least a two-year period.

Moreover, they have routinely overstated their cybersecurity best practices and misled investors.  \n\nSEC’s complaint seeks “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar against Brown”, SolarWinds’ CISO. \n\nSEC’s actions show that cybersecurity should be taken seriously and should include adequate prevention as well as remediation strategies, otherwise companies may face serious legal consequences.  \n\nIt is important to identify ongoing risks and apply effective measures to increase security posture, but also to take an objective and realistic view. The SEC statement reveals that an internal document from SolarWinds’ mentions that “the volume of security issues being identified over the last month have outstripped the capacity of Engineering teams to resolve.”  \n\nThis is not an uncommon predicament. Companies frequently find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to security issues and often fail to allocate enough funds and personnel to rectify them. Furthermore, ‘alert fatigue’ is a rapidly growing problem, where security tools generate so many alerts that assessing and fixing them becomes an impossible task.  \n\nThis is one of the key issues Cyscale set out to solve. Through the application of context to each security alert, Cyscale’s mission is to help companies overcome the challenges of slim resources and budgets by prioritizing security issues and guiding professionals to work on the 20% of things that matter and make 80% of the difference.\n"}}],"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/a005e76c44581c38cf1d4d1e54e522c0/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","3058837307","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
