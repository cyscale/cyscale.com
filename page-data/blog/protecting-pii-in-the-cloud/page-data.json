PII can be used with or without other data to identify an individual. \n\nExamples of Personally Identifiable Information are: \n\n* name, \n* social security number, \n* biometric records, \n* unique personal document numbers such as passport or driver’s license number, \n* medical, educational, financial history, and many others. \n\nPII information can be categorized into two parts: \n\n1. Linked information. This type of data can on its own single out an individual. \n2. Unlinked information. A person cannot be directly traced based on it, but if combined with another piece of information it could identify an individual. Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["News"],"title":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","seoTitle":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","description":"Explore how AWS's new IPv4 billing changes, effective from February 2024, will influence both your financial and security strategies.

Whether you are a seasoned cloud engineer or a business decision-maker this shift by one of the world's leading cloud providers will likely have broad implications.\n\nAWS's decision aligns with other major cloud providers that have adopted similar practices, reflecting an industry-wide trend. AWS's involvement is particularly significant given its substantial market presence, and it will likely influence various organizations across different scales and industries.\n\nIn terms of your business and the tech landscape, this change goes beyond additional costs, with the new model affecting network planning, igniting considerations about transitioning to IPv6, and opening opportunities to reassess cloud security strategies.\n\n## The Financial Implications of AWS's New Charging Model for IPv4 Addresses\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Pricing\n\nStarting February 1, 2024, AWS will charge for all public IPv4 addresses at a rate of 0.5 cents per hour. While this figure may initially seem inconsequential, it is vital to understand how swiftly it can accumulate. \n\nFor small businesses or individual projects, the impact might be marginal. Our example considers a small organization with 10 public IP addresses:\n\n*10 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $36.5 per month, or $438 per year.*\n\nContrast this with an enterprise operating with 11,000 public IPs: \n\n*11,000 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $40,150 per month, or nearly **$500,000 per year**.*\n\n1﻿1,000 IP addresses might sound like an overestimation, but we are seeing organizations with tens of thousands of EC2 instances. Assuming 20-30% of these need public IPs is not out of reach.\n\nThis striking difference highlights the importance of understanding and planning for the financial consequences, particularly for organizations heavily reliant on public IPv4 addresses.\n\n### Budget Considerations for Organizations\n\nAWS's decision to charge for public IPv4 addresses extends beyond a simple financial concern; it prompts businesses to reevaluate their entire approach to IP address utilization. Key considerations include:\n\n* **Reviewing existing usage:** Analyzing current usage patterns is essential for predicting additional costs and identifying opportunities for optimization.\n* **Considering IPv6 migration:** Some may find transitioning to IPv6 a cost-effective alternative, though it must be balanced against compatibility and technical constraints.\n* **Utilizing tools and insights:** Automated security platforms like Cyscale can offer comprehensive insights into your inventory of public IP addresses, helping you understand the big picture and delivering insight that can aid in cost control.\n\nThis policy change serves as a catalyst for reimagining how organizations approach cloud infrastructure financially. The ripple effects will be felt differently across the spectrum, but the core message is clear: understanding, planning, and adapting will be pivotal in navigating this change without unforeseen financial setbacks.\n\nWhether you are a decision-maker concerned about the bottom line or a cloud professional tasked with optimization, these changes necessitate close scrutiny and proactive planning.\n\n## Technical Aspects and Considerations\n\n### Impact on EC2 Instances, RDS, EKS, etc.\n\nThe new charging model impacts a broad array of resources, including EC2 instances, RDS, EKS, load balancers, and more. Managing complex architectures now entails a new layer of complexity, possibly requiring a reassessment of networking strategies and configurations.\n\n### The Complexity of Managing Multiple IP Addresses per Resource\n\nSome resources may have more than one public IPv4 address. Managing these involves not just technical configuration but also financial planning. Understanding how these multiple IPs interact within your infrastructure and contribute to overall costs is essential. \n\n### Discussion on the Feasibility and Challenges of Switching to IPv6\n\nThe move to IPv6 seems logical, but it's not devoid of challenges. Compatibility with services and APIs managed by others might become a hurdle. AWS has made progress, such as enabling communication from EC2 to Lambda functions over IPv6 (note that you cannot reach an EC2 instance from Lambda over IPv6), yet some cases may still hinder a complete switch.\n\n### IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms\n\nDuring the transition, Network Address Translation (NAT), specifically NAT64, becomes vital. This mechanism translates IPv6 to IPv4 addresses, bridging communication between newer IPv6 systems and legacy IPv4 systems. Understanding and utilizing NAT64 is crucial for modernizing without losing functionality. Equally important is DNS64 which performs the translation at the DNS level. More specifically, in the case a domain is mapped only to an IPv4 address (i.e., it only has A records), DNS64 translates an A record (specific to IPv4) to an AAAA record (specific to IPv6), thus allowing an IPv6 client to reach an IPv4 server.\n\n### Proficiency with Security Groups and Other Network Considerations\n\nWith all IPv6 addresses being public, mastering security groups and leveraging egress-only internet gateways become even more critical. Properly configuring security rules and comprehending their interaction with different IP versions plays a significant role in upholding security and functionality within your network.\n\nThe new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a financial consideration. It intertwines with a multifaceted web of technical aspects that must be thoughtfully navigated. Embracing the right strategies and tools can pave the way for a seamless transition, preserving both efficiency and budget.\n\n## Security Implications\n\n### Reevaluation of Network Exposure\n\nThe new charges for public IPv4 addresses might encourage organizations to scrutinize network exposure more closely. Reducing the number of public IPs could be both a cost-saving measure and a strategy to enhance security by limiting the **attack surface.**\n\n### Importance of Secure Configuration in IPv6 Transition\n\nTransitioning to IPv6, while potentially cost-effective, demands careful consideration of security configurations. Understanding IPv6 security nuances is vital in safeguarding systems during and after the shift. While NAT64 facilitates communication between IPv6 and IPv4 systems, it also introduces unique security considerations. Proper implementation and continuous vigilance are required to ward off vulnerabilities that might arise during the translation process. In practice, most organizations will leverage the AWS NAT Gateway which already supports NAT64 and DNS64 (through Route 53) so our responsibility includes proper route configuration and keeping DNS resolvers up to date. However, other organizations might choose to deploy their own NAT instance to optimize cost.\n\n### Tools and Platforms for Security Management\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale can play a pivotal role in this secure transition. By providing insights into all public IP addresses, their attachments, and alternative communication paths, they can facilitate a more secure and cost-effective migration. Utilizing specialized security platforms and tools is fundamental to maintaining control over complex cloud environments.\n\nThis new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a technical and financial hurdle; it's an opportunity to rethink and potentially enhance security strategies. By understanding the interplay between IPv4 and IPv6, the role of the transition mechanisms, and the necessity of proper security configurations, organizations can navigate this transition without compromising security.\n\n## The Role of Cloud Security Platforms\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale are more than just a reactive measure to changes like AWS's new charging model for public IPv4 addresses; they represent a proactive approach to modern cloud infrastructure management. By providing tools that cut across cost optimization, security enhancement, migration planning, and collaboration, these holistic solutions enable organizations to thrive in an evolving cloud landscape."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM and Other Features You Never Knew Existed ","seoTitle":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM","description":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","seoDescription":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","date":"2023-08-23T15:16:04.584Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/41be8/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/c78f7/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/913d0/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/91660/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/888e2/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"While assessing the controls suggested by the CIS Benchmark 2.0.0 for Google Cloud, I stumbled upon an interesting recommendation: to launch compute instances with Shielded VM enabled. When you think of VM security, you think of open management ports, outdated OS versions, unencrypted VM disks and so on. So what is Shielded VM and why do you need to enable it ASAP? \n\n\n\n## Shielded VM \n\nShielded VM, in a cloud computing context, is a security solution that hardens VMs deployed in Google Cloud. This measure protects them against rootkits and bootkits, which are essentially malware that infect and obtain persistence in VMs, allowing attackers to infiltrate in the cloud environment through the Compute Instances. It’s like a magical portal into your entire cloud infrastructure, which, if created, opens on command for the hackers.    \n\nThe advantage of this setting is that, with just a few clicks, you significantly increase the protection of your [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) VM by providing it with: \n\n* Secure Boot, \n* vTPM, \n* Integrity monitoring. \n\n**Secure Boot** is a feature that verifies the digital signature of all boot components of a virtual machine. In this way, if any signature verification fails, that boot process is halted, thus ensuring that only authentic software is run on the system. This means that you cannot use any custom drivers on the machine, because if you do, it will cause the VM to not boot anymore. If a failure occurs, the user receives two errors:\n\n* **UEFI: Failed to load image**, and \n* **Status: Security Violation.** \n\n**vTPM, or Virtual Trusted Platform Module,** is a computer chip specialized in protecting secrets. To understand what vTPM is, let’s break it down. TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a hardware component that stores cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive data securely. By virtualizing it, the same result is achieved, but on a software level, meaning that VMs in the cloud can also be protected using a TPM, even though at hardware-level they may share components with other VMs. \n\nvTPM also introduces **Measure Boot**, a mechanism that checks the integrity of the VM’s components. When the VM first boots, Measure Boot establishes an **integrity policy** baseline by calculating hashes of the components, concatenating them and rehashing them into a final hash to guarantee a sound integrity monitoring. Then, every time the VM boots up, the hash is recalculated and checked against the initial one, thus being able to tell if there are any changes in the boot process. \n\nThe integrity policy baseline needs to be updated if changes appear, such as a system update. \n\nThrough the process described, **integrity monitoring** is achieved using Shielded VM and the Measure Boot mechanism. \n\n\n\n### How to enable Shielded VM \n\nTo enable Shielded VM, you can do it through the Google Cloud console, or using the Cloud shell.  \n\n**Using the Google Cloud console** \n\n1. Log in to your Google Cloud console and navigate to Compute Instances (or click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)). \n2. For each VM on which you want to enable the feature, follow these steps: \n\n   1. Click on the VM name to go to its details page.\n   2. On the upper right area of the page, select EDIT. \n   3. Scroll down to “Security and access” and check boxes accordingly to your desired settings. Please note that you cannot select “Integrity Monitoring” without checking “Turn on vTPM”, as Integrity monitoring is a feature provided by vTPM. \n\n**Using the Cloud shell** \n\n1. Stop the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances stop <instanceName>`\n\n2. Turn on vTPM and Integrity Monitoring: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vtpm --shieldedvm-integrity-monitoring`\n\n3. To also turn on Secure Boot (if you have no custom or unsigned drivers on the instance), add the *\\--shielded-vm-secure-boot* parameter to the previous command or execute the following command separately: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vm-secure-boot` \n\n4. After applying the changes, restart the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances start <instanceName>`\n\nNote that Shielded VM is not enabled by default on a VM. However, you can set an organizational policy that will cause all the future VMs to have Shielded VM enabled. To do that, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm).  \n\n\n\n#### Other configurations that you should consider for your Google Cloud VMs \n\nThere are some settings you should always check when assessing the security of a virtual machine. Here are just a few examples: \n\n* Use **confidential computing** to [encrypt in-use data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this way, your data that is processed, trained on, used, queried on your VMs remains encrypted and is not at risk. \n* **Close management ports** if not needed: RDP (3389), SSH (21), WINRM (5985), these are all open gateways for hackers to intrude in your VMs and further down your cloud environment. \n* **Apply patches, OS updates** and any other available updates on your VMs to keep them up to date with the current versions of software and ensure that you’re not leaving them vulnerable to found exploits. \n* **Do not use public IP addresses** for your Compute instances, if possible. Public IP addresses introduce the same vulnerability in your environment as management ports: you increase your attack surface and expose the VM to the Internet. Instead, use load balancers to “hide” your VMs. \n\nAlthough there are many aspects you should consider when setting up your cloud [infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) securely, use this article as a checklist to tick off some of the most important security configurations."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Cloud Security Challenges: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Solutions for 2023","seoTitle":"Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges: Threats and Solutions for 2023","description":"Understand the top 10 cloud security challenges, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, and learn how to build a roadmap to create a robust cloud security strategy for 2023 and beyond.

Protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance has become paramount for professionals like Solutions Architects, CISOs, Cloud Security Researchers, DevOps Engineers, and others in the technology space tasked with ensuring transformative technologies remain secure. \n\nBut what exactly are the top cloud security challenges, and why are they a matter of pressing concern? Whether its data breaches caused by cyberattacks or vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, cloud security threats are multifaceted and evolving, quickly outpacing our human ability to keep up. \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top 10 cloud security challenges and present a roadmap for creating a robust cloud security strategy, with real-life examples, actionable solutions, and insights to aid your journey towards a secure cloud. \n\n## Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges \n\nThe digital landscape is filled with opportunities, but it is not without its obstacles. Cloud security challenges represent significant hurdles that organizations must overcome to fully leverage the power of cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet's dive into the top 10 challenges that are shaping the conversation in 2023: \n\n### 1. Vulnerabilities in Cloud Infrastructure: \n\nThe rise of cloud computing has unveiled a plethora of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Whether it's poorly designed APIs or weak authentication protocols, these vulnerabilities are often the entry points for unauthorized access. \n\nThe famous [Equifax data breach in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) occurred due to a vulnerability in an Apache Struts framework that allowed attackers to leak data using a vulnerable API. That breach affected approximately 147 million customers. \n\n### 2. Security Threats from Hackers and Malware: \n\nHackers continually evolve their techniques to breach cloud security defenses or simply take services offline. From sophisticated malware to phishing attacks and holding services to ransom, the threats are relentless and require constant vigilance and real-time security solutions.  \n\nIn early 2023, one botnet conducted a complex DDoS attack that was able to issue between 50 and 70 million requests per second originating from different cloud providers, [according to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/). VMs in the cloud can be both targets of DDoS attacks, as well as unwitting participants if a compromise goes undetected. \n\n### 3. Misconfigurations and Human Errors: \n\nSimple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic data breaches and with many companies facing a complex and sprawling cloud infrastructure it’s easy to make mistakes. Human error, whether accidental or due to lack of understanding of cloud configurations, is a consistent challenge. \n\nLet’s look at a common cloud misconfiguration example: your S3 bucket, which contains sensitive data about your customers, is publicly accessible. It sounds obvious, but a simple setting - making the bucket private - can prevent someone from the Internet accessing the data. However, if you are not aware of that configuration, this simple oversight might become a significant problem for your company; this is why it is very important to continuously monitor for misconfigurations and ensure you fix any findings in a timely manner. \n\n### 4. Insider Threats and Unauthorized Access: \n\nFrom disgruntled employees to compromised credentials, insider threats pose a unique and often overlooked challenge. Rigorous access control and monitoring are essential.  \n\nMoreover, a robust offboarding process for users is important to ensure that former employees no longer have access to the company’s assets after they have left the organization. Although the process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious, there should be a well-defined set of steps to check access rights when an employee leaves the company. After all, a favorite exercise of compliance auditors is to check a list of recently departed employees against current permissions and entitlements.  \n\n### 5. Cloud Service Providers and Shared Responsibility Model: \n\nUnderstanding the shared responsibility model with cloud service providers (CSPs) like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is vital. The delineation of responsibilities can sometimes be blurred, leading to security gaps.  \n\nFor example, if a user thinks that the cloud provider secures a virtual machine, they might neglect:  \n\n* closing management ports such as RDP (3389) and SSH (22), \n* using network security tools (such as firewalls, access control lists, network security groups), \n* managing VM disk encryption. \n\nThis might leave the VM unprotected because of the expectation that security is ‘somebody else’s problem’. \n\n### 6. Data Breaches and Loss: \n\nProtecting sensitive data is at the heart of cloud security. Data breaches and loss due to cyberattacks, human error, or even natural disasters can have devastating effects on organizations. Having PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stolen or leaked can lead to very grave consequences for a company. \n\nIn January 2023, the American wireless network provider T-Mobile revealed that a data breach that [potentially affected 37 million accounts occurred](https://www.reuters.com/technology/t-mobile-says-investigating-data-breach-affecting-37-mln-accounts-2023-01-19/) during 2022. Names, billing addresses, emails and phone numbers were some of the data that was leaked through an API with no authorization. Immediately in the wake of the news, T-Mobile stock fell 1%, and the company is currently under investigation by the FCC which could lead to further penalties.  \n\n### 7. Non-Compliance and Legal Risks: \n\nAdhering to regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA in the cloud can be complex. Non-compliance carries both legal risks and potential damage to reputation, especially for organizations in regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare. Compliance with international standards and laws ensures that: \n\n* Your company follows current cybersecurity best practices, \n* The reputation of your company is well maintained due to the continuous efforts to remain compliant. \n\nTo understand how serious non-compliance penalties can be, HIPAA is a good example. The maximum financial penalty for a HIPAA financial is almost $2 million, while criminal penalties can put the wrong-doer in jail for up to 10 years. It’s worth noting that regulation is also trending in the direction of at fault executives being held personally accountable, including jail time, to ensure that infringements can’t be offset by profits.  \n\nOne of the worst HIPAA violation cases happened in 2008 in one of the UCLA Health System hospitals. Employees accessed celebrity patients' medical records without authorization. A settlement of $865,000 was paid by the hospital, and the employees faced disciplinary actions. In general, employee discipline only goes as far as termination of employment but in some cases, employees have done time behind bars. \n\n### 8. Security Controls and Configurations: \n\nA security control in the cloud is a measure implemented based on a recommendation, a best practice or a requirement, designed to ensure that security and compliance of cloud resources and configurations are achieved.  \n\nImplementing and managing the right security controls and configurations is critical and tools like a Cloud Security Posture Management ([CSPM) platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) can be instrumental in managing these aspects effectively. Some tools, like Cyscale, go even further and visibility is greatly improved by bringing all of the security controls into one place, compared to multiple lists and dashboards of controls for each cloud provider, which can make it particularly challenging to see the big picture in the case of multi-cloud infrastructures. \n\n### 9. Endpoint Security and Real-time Protections: \n\nEndpoints are any device connected to a network. Examples of devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, point of sale terminals, and others. \n\nWith the rise of IoT and mobile workforces, securing endpoints and implementing real-time protections is more important than ever and more challenging given that these endpoints are often in the possession of individuals or at not easily accessible locations. A compromised or stolen laptop belonging to a senior engineer might be a good example here.  \n\nReal-time protection allows for threat detection and rapid response to attacks as they happen, as well as data loss prevention. For example, if you detect that a suspicious identity has connected to one of your VMs in the cloud, you can quickly act and cut off that identity before it can pivot to other cloud resources in your infrastructure. \n\n### 10. Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud Environments: \n\nManaging security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduces complexity.  \n\nMulti-cloud setups demand the appropriate handling of various security controls specific to each cloud provider and maintaining visibility across them, while hybrid models require seamless integration and consistent policies between on-premises and public cloud assets. In both cases, the complexity of the infrastructure and policies increases, making it crucial to stay on top of your security posture. \n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the cloud environment, robust strategies, and leveraging solutions like [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nThe good news? These challenges aren't insurmountable. In the sections that follow, we'll explore best practices to fortify your cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Section 2: Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment.
