But while these developments have made it easier than ever to deploy applications, they have dramatically changed the landscape in terms of security.   \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture to traditional non-native applications, it is essential to understand how the key features of cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns and are driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) as a result.  \n\n## How is cloud-native infrastructure different?  \n\nCloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes. Cloud-native applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). \n\nThese technologies significantly increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but they introduce new concerns in terms of security along with a much larger attack surface area.   \n\n## What is a CNAPP? \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP is becoming a necessary solution to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.   \n\nCoined by Gartner, [cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are described as a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.  \n\nOne of the key features being that CNAPPs consolidate several previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), runtime cloud workload protection and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning, into one solution. \n\nThis guide will help you understand the most important features of a CNAPP that secure cloud-native applications and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:   \n\n* [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) (Cloud Security Posture Management)   \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)  \n* [CIEM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iam-security/) (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management)  \n* [KSPM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/kubernetes-security-platform/) (Kubernetes Security Posture Management)  \n* Container Security \n\n**G﻿et an overview of CNAPP capabilities**\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/Cyscale-explainer-video-2023-12-Dec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n## Visibility of cloud-native infrastructure \n\nWhereas traditional environments relied largely on proprietary software, isolated hardware, and almost total control of the stack, cloud-native environments may stretch across multiple clouds, make use of open-source code, require identity-based segmentation, and feature ephemeral workloads.   \n\nAs a result, context-aware visibility of all these assets and resources is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Not only is the surface area for attack dramatically increased, you also need to determine whether a vulnerability in one resource is innocuous or if it creates a toxic combination through its relationship with other assets.   \n\nA misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access and serve as a jumping-off point to more resources, for example.   \n\nTherefore, the visibility features found in CSPM solutions are incorporated into CNAPP to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. Usually, visibility comes in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can illustrate current security scores, assets that need your attention, and other elements that may help you understand your cloud. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see all your cloud resources in one place, so as to be constantly aware of your cloud environment? \n* Does it provide full coverage and visibility into your cloud estate and risks, including cloud configuration, workload, and identity? \n* Does it bring your multi-cloud infrastructure together in one tool and deliver risk-aware context? \n* Does it identify assets that might or have drifted from your organization’s compliance baseline? \n\n## Cloud-native security controls  \n\nManually going through every cloud asset configuration to check for issues and vulnerabilities is tedious and error prone in smaller estates and impossible in large cloud environments where thousands of assets are in use. Don’t forget that the approach for AWS is different to that of Azure, is different to Google Cloud, and different again with Kubernetes.   \n\nA certified expert in one environment does not equal transferable skills to another.  \n\nTo solve these challenges, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and either automate the remediation of or provide guidance to address issues. The application of automation, using Machine Learning and AI, not only saves considerable time but reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP provide contextual triaging and prioritization or send targeted alerts for high-priority assets to reduce and relieve alert fatigue? \n* Does it detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, enabling you to react and fix findings quickly, saving your organization from a breach? \n* Does it deliver efficient remediation steps on detected issues? \n\n## Data security in the cloud \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications with ephemeral workloads and infrastructure that is scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be unwittingly exposed. Through DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, CNAPPs can help keep track of data stores and provide actionable suggestions for your organization to secure your crown jewels. \n\nA CNAPP will detect and highlight unencrypted storage resources, cryptographic keys with insecure configurations or upcoming expirations, assets that are publicly accessible, and other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may leave your organization’s sensitive data exposed.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Are the Data Security Dashboard capabilities of the CNAPP capable of pinpointing blind spots in your infrastructure? \n* Some cloud providers encrypt data in storage resources by default, while others do not so it is easy to overlook what you think you know and miss important details. Does the CNAPP help you understand your encryption status? \n* Instead of dealing with cryptographic key rotation and deletion, some CNAPPs show you what keys need to be rotated and when. Does the CNAPP provide this capability? \n\n## Container image scanning   \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.   \n\nRetroactively, a CNAPP can identify which container images have vulnerabilities and where those images are running in your infrastructure. \n\nFor example, if a container image uses an unpatched version of Log4J, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications in that container.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP check container images for vulnerabilities to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your infrastructure? \n* Does the CNAPP help you understand who has permissions over containers to prevent unauthorized access? \n* Are you able to monitor for and identify any misconfigurations developers might have missed when spinning up containers? \n\n## Cloud workloads protection  \n\nThe Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) component of a CNAPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in CVEs and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them.  \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes:  \n\n* VMs \n* Containers  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see running workloads in one dashboard to easily keep you up to date with your organization’s activity all the time? \n* Does it help you prioritize vulnerable workloads efficiently based on severity to ensure effective remediation measures? \n* Does it automatically keep up with emerging threats, so you don’t have to check the news all the time? Your CNAPP should do the work for you by constantly checking your workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\n## Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior.  \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are:  \n\n* Unauthorized access   \n* Missing patches   \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP give you visibility of your Kubernetes objects? \n* Does it help you assess your cluster based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark, which contains up-to-date and industry-standard best practices? \n* Does it detect vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster with no need for manual effort from your team? You should be able to see where you have Kubernetes images with vulnerabilities and where those images are deployed.  \n\n## CIEM and IAM: Access management   \n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is an essential component of cloud-native applications security specific to the CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) part of the platform. With complex cloud environments, keeping track of users and services, their different access levels, and what impact certain permissions have can become challenging.  \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to, but not limited to, the following aspects:  \n\n* Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making them more difficult to manage  \n* Cloud-native software may run across multi-cloud environments as well as on-premises  \n* The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing identities at the service level \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to better secure their cloud in terms of identity and access management.   \n\n## Best practices regarding IAM:  \n\n* Implement multi-factor authentication for all users. This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification  \n* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity  \n* Comply with the Least Privilege Principle to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary for the user to do their job  \n* Assign permissions at group level and assign well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP identify any drifts from your company’s security or compliance posture using a powerful IAM dashboard that pinpoints users with issues, such as the ones that do not have MFA enabled? \n* Does the CNAPP give you an understanding of your password policies and identify if users have old passwords? \n* Does it help you understand if users or groups have more permissions than necessary? \n* Does the CNAPP support you in performing effective access reviews that don’t take all day and require no manual work? \n* Does it help you gain confidence in your organization’s security posture? \n\n## Compliance  \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their compliance journey. The CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet the requirements of various compliance frameworks.   \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to perform assessments in preparation for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards a CNAPP should provide support for are are:  \n\n* ISO 27001   \n* SOC 2  \n* GDPR  \n* PCI-DSS  \n* HIPAA  \n* NIST \n\nOther standards like DORA are becoming increasingly important for some sectors, and there are regional equivalents of some regulations like Brazil’s LGDP data protection laws. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP help you track your compliance progress in real-time and ensure you are able to understand how your organization is doing in terms of compliance posture? \n* Does the CNAPP keep a track record of your efforts that can be presented during an audit? \n* Are all of your organization's cloud resources tracked in one place, so you know that the compliance assessment is comprehensive and accurate and you're not missing anything? \n* Can you view your compliance score at-a-glance and at any time? \n* Are you able to export detailed reports to help explain your security and compliance posture to other stakeholders or to help you make a case to the board? \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/full-platform-tour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">TAKE A TOUR OF CYSCALE'S CNAPP</button></a></div>\n\n## Summary: CNAPP as a critical part of cloud-native security \n\nAs cloud-native application development has penetrated the market, it has not only expanded the infrastructure estate but also the number of teams involved, from devops, to platform engineers, cloud architects, security experts, compliance practitioners, and more.  \n\nLikewise, security solutions have evolved in tandem, moving beyond the more static nature of the CSPM, to the more dynamic capabilities of a CNAPP, with an integrated, lifecycle security and compliance approach to protecting workloads and applications. \n\nThe vendor landscape is competitive and vendor portfolios have either grown through acquisition or original development. The result is that many established vendor CNAPP offerings are bolted together point solutions with little or no integration.  \n\nCloud-native organizations going down this route will need to ensure they have the resources available to learn and operate several different tools and even take on some of the work around correlation and context in cloud security.  \n\nThe main concern with challenger or incoming CNAPP vendors, on the other hand, might be a lack of maturity in the components, even though the platform itself is designed with integration in mind.  \n\nOrganizations will need to carefully assess the capabilities of the CNAPP solution to ensure it meets their specific needs, without requiring too many resources or investments, and with room for future growth.  \n\nThat said, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are regarded as a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, its high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient.  \n\n### C﻿hoosing a CNAPP\n\n**Overall, CNAPP solutions offer:**  \n\n1.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

It’s not always by choice \n\nA multi-cloud strategy can combine the best of two (or more!) worlds, allowing cloud-native organizations to choose best-of-breed options for building apps and storing data in the cloud. At least this is true when the multi-cloud approach is by design.  \n\nIt’s not unheard of for a multi-cloud approach to happen by accident. Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security","CNAPP"],"title":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Data Plane vs. Management Plane, Access Roles and More","seoTitle":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Access Roles and More","description":"Azure Key Vault securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services.

And while it’s your safest bet to keep your crypto keys, certificates, and other secrets safe, it can become your worst enemy if you don’t manage it correctly. \n\n## What is Azure Key Vault? \n\nBefore we begin looking at best practices and security features of Key Vault, let’s go over the basics. \n\nAzure Key Vault is a Microsoft Azure product that securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services. It also allows users to manage a key's lifecycle, from key generation to destruction. \n\n*Did you know that if you create a key in a Key Vault, you can never actually see it? This is to safeguard against a human leaking the key. This also applies to imported keys.* \n\nAzure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard and Premium. The only difference between them is that Premium allows HSM protection for keys. HSM (Hardware Security Module) provides hardware security on top of the software security supplied by Azure as a fully managed, single tenant, premium safeguard. This is the most stringent security measure that can be applied to crypto keys. \n\n## Access control management in Azure Key Vault \n\nKey Vault authorization is done on two different planes: \n\n* The management plane, which allows users to delete key vaults, update access policies, and see properties, and \n* The data plane, where Key Vault objects can be added, deleted and modified. \n\nBasically, if you have access to the management plane, you can modify the cloud resource but have no access to the actual data in it. The opposite goes for the data plane, where you can make operations on the secrets, keys, and certificates but cannot, for example, add or remove access policies. You can delete a key, but not the actual key vault. \n\nNow that we know the difference between the two planes, let's look at some of the most used built-in RBAC roles for Key Vaults. Remember that Role Base Access Controls (RBAC) are used to restrict access to the network based on the user’s role. \n\n*Authorization for the data plane can be done using Azure Key Vault access policies as well as RBAC roles, but for the management plane, only RBAC roles can be used. Access policies are now considered legacy, and we recommend using RBAC.* \n\nAnd while access control policies help you define fine-grained control over objects and resources, this is not the way to go anymore. Policies are not a centralized management solution, meaning that you can’t just see and change permissions in one place; you would have to check each policy to see what a user's effective permissions are. Moreover, removing permissions can be difficult; the user no longer needs access to keys? Instead of going over one or more policies and unchecking the boxes that give them access, you can just remove their Key Vault Crypto Officer role, and you’re done! That way you don’t risk forgetting about a policy in the process. \n\nTo transition from access policies to RBAC, assess current permissions for all users, change to an RBAC permission model, establish the correct roles for them (and follow the Least Privilege Principle), assign those roles, and thoroughly test the setup. And to know which Key Vault Roles to use, keep reading this article! \n\n## Roles in Azure Key Vault \n\nManaging access control correctly and using the appropriate role for the job is good practice for cloud security. Following the Least Privilege Principle and only providing the necessary permissions are the keys to minimizing attack surfaces and giving your cloud environment the best chance against attackers. \n\nLet’s look at some of the available built-in Key Vault roles provided by Microsoft Azure. Remember that these roles only work if you've set Azure RBAC as the permission model (which is recommended). \n\n1. **Key Vault Reader**: This role provides the user with permission to read metadata of key vaults and their objects (certificates, keys, secrets). \n2. **Key Vault Administrator**: As an Administrator, you have all data plane permissions on all types of objects. \n3. **Key Vault Secrets Officer, Key Vault Certificates Officer, Key Vault Crypto Officer**: These three roles allow users to perform all actions on the type of Key Vault object the role is for, except managing permissions. So, a Key Vault Certificates Officer would have permissions on certificates, and so on. \n4. **Key Vault Secrets User, Key Vault Crypto User**: These roles are similar to the previous one but have fewer permissions. The Secrets user can see the secret contents. The Crypto user can perform cryptographic operations using the keys stored in the Key Vault. *Notice how there’s no Key Vault Certificates User? The Secrets user can also read the secret portion of a certificate with a private key, so apps use this role to retrieve certificates.* \n\nKeep in mind that users who can manage permissions over the Key Vault can grant themselves data plane permissions by modifying the access policies, so this plane segregation only goes so far. For this reason, I will once again remind you – follow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)! Don't give users more permissions than the bare minimum they need to do their job.  \n\nExcess privileges can be a gateway to disaster.  \n\n## Safety and recovery features in Azure Key Vault \n\nAzure Key Vault has a very useful feature called **soft-delete**. This allows for Key Vaults and Key Vault objects to remain recoverable for a period of 7 to 90 days (if no period is specified, then the default is set to 90). So, if someone accidentally deletes something, it can still be recovered within that timeframe. \n\n*Soft-delete is set to Enabled by default for new Key Vaults, and if a Key Vault has soft-delete enabled, it can never be disabled.* By design, Azure Key Vault makes it hard for users to lose their keys! \n\nBesides soft-delete, there’s also **purge protection**. This is another safety feature that goes beyond soft-delete, by preventing accidental **permanent** deletion. If you want to protect your Azure Key Vault from deletion while it is in its soft-deleted state, it ensures that no-one can delete it before the soft-delete period is over. **Once purge protection is enabled, just like soft-delete, it cannot be disabled.**  \n\nTo purge a Key Vault or a Key Vault object, you must have special permissions that are not, by default, given to any role. *The argument –enable-purge-protection can also be set to true to prevent anyone from purging a resource.*  \n\nIf this sounds all complicated, we can sum it up easily: once you delete a soft-delete-enabled Key Vault resource, it goes into the soft-delete state for a set period. If you also have purge protection enabled, you can't force delete it before that period is up. It's a layered protection model; you must go through multiple steps to delete a resource, making it as fool-proof as possible.  \n\nIn terms of backup, Azure recommends that you only backup secrets that are business critical; due to the nature of Key Vaults, the objects stored in them are already ensured availability: “Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically failover requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user”.  \n\nYou also can't back up your vault. It can be an annoyance, but you must back up each object and then restore them one by one. To do this, you download a blob containing the secret in an encrypted form, which you can then upload back in your Azure Key Vault. You have to upload it back in the same subscription to be able to use it (and, of course, in Azure Key Vault, not somewhere else). \n\n## Logging and protection in Azure Key Vault \n\nBesides following the best practices described in this article, you can also enable **Microsoft Defender for Key Vault**. This enables: \n\n* threat detection,  \n* threat intelligence,  \n* anomaly detection, and  \n* behavior analytics. \n\nAlso, don't forget about logging!
