But while these developments have made it easier than ever to deploy applications, they have dramatically changed the landscape in terms of security.   \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture to traditional non-native applications, it is essential to understand how the key features of cloud-native applications introduce new and specific security concerns and are driving the adoption of the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) as a result.  \n\n## How is cloud-native infrastructure different?  \n\nCloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes. Cloud-native applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). \n\nThese technologies significantly increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but they introduce new concerns in terms of security along with a much larger attack surface area.   \n\n## What is a CNAPP? \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP is becoming a necessary solution to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.   \n\nCoined by Gartner, [cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPPs)](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are described as a unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to secure and protect cloud-native applications across development and production.  \n\nOne of the key features being that CNAPPs consolidate several previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), runtime cloud workload protection and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning, into one solution. \n\nThis guide will help you understand the most important features of a CNAPP that secure cloud-native applications and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:   \n\n* [CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) (Cloud Security Posture Management)   \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)  \n* [CIEM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/iam-security/) (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management)  \n* [KSPM](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/kubernetes-security-platform/) (Kubernetes Security Posture Management)  \n* Container Security \n\n**G﻿et an overview of CNAPP capabilities**\n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/Cyscale-explainer-video-2023-12-Dec.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n## Visibility of cloud-native infrastructure \n\nWhereas traditional environments relied largely on proprietary software, isolated hardware, and almost total control of the stack, cloud-native environments may stretch across multiple clouds, make use of open-source code, require identity-based segmentation, and feature ephemeral workloads.   \n\nAs a result, context-aware visibility of all these assets and resources is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Not only is the surface area for attack dramatically increased, you also need to determine whether a vulnerability in one resource is innocuous or if it creates a toxic combination through its relationship with other assets.   \n\nA misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access and serve as a jumping-off point to more resources, for example.   \n\nTherefore, the visibility features found in CSPM solutions are incorporated into CNAPP to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. Usually, visibility comes in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can illustrate current security scores, assets that need your attention, and other elements that may help you understand your cloud. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see all your cloud resources in one place, so as to be constantly aware of your cloud environment? \n* Does it provide full coverage and visibility into your cloud estate and risks, including cloud configuration, workload, and identity? \n* Does it bring your multi-cloud infrastructure together in one tool and deliver risk-aware context? \n* Does it identify assets that might or have drifted from your organization’s compliance baseline? \n\n## Cloud-native security controls  \n\nManually going through every cloud asset configuration to check for issues and vulnerabilities is tedious and error prone in smaller estates and impossible in large cloud environments where thousands of assets are in use. Don’t forget that the approach for AWS is different to that of Azure, is different to Google Cloud, and different again with Kubernetes.   \n\nA certified expert in one environment does not equal transferable skills to another.  \n\nTo solve these challenges, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and either automate the remediation of or provide guidance to address issues. The application of automation, using Machine Learning and AI, not only saves considerable time but reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP provide contextual triaging and prioritization or send targeted alerts for high-priority assets to reduce and relieve alert fatigue? \n* Does it detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time, enabling you to react and fix findings quickly, saving your organization from a breach? \n* Does it deliver efficient remediation steps on detected issues? \n\n## Data security in the cloud \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications with ephemeral workloads and infrastructure that is scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be unwittingly exposed. Through DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, CNAPPs can help keep track of data stores and provide actionable suggestions for your organization to secure your crown jewels. \n\nA CNAPP will detect and highlight unencrypted storage resources, cryptographic keys with insecure configurations or upcoming expirations, assets that are publicly accessible, and other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may leave your organization’s sensitive data exposed.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Are the Data Security Dashboard capabilities of the CNAPP capable of pinpointing blind spots in your infrastructure? \n* Some cloud providers encrypt data in storage resources by default, while others do not so it is easy to overlook what you think you know and miss important details. Does the CNAPP help you understand your encryption status? \n* Instead of dealing with cryptographic key rotation and deletion, some CNAPPs show you what keys need to be rotated and when. Does the CNAPP provide this capability? \n\n## Container image scanning   \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.   \n\nRetroactively, a CNAPP can identify which container images have vulnerabilities and where those images are running in your infrastructure. \n\nFor example, if a container image uses an unpatched version of Log4J, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications in that container.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP check container images for vulnerabilities to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your infrastructure? \n* Does the CNAPP help you understand who has permissions over containers to prevent unauthorized access? \n* Are you able to monitor for and identify any misconfigurations developers might have missed when spinning up containers? \n\n## Cloud workloads protection  \n\nThe Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) component of a CNAPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in CVEs and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them.  \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes:  \n\n* VMs \n* Containers  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP enable you to see running workloads in one dashboard to easily keep you up to date with your organization’s activity all the time? \n* Does it help you prioritize vulnerable workloads efficiently based on severity to ensure effective remediation measures? \n* Does it automatically keep up with emerging threats, so you don’t have to check the news all the time? Your CNAPP should do the work for you by constantly checking your workloads for newly discovered vulnerabilities. \n\n## Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior.  \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are:  \n\n* Unauthorized access   \n* Missing patches   \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP give you visibility of your Kubernetes objects? \n* Does it help you assess your cluster based on the CIS Kubernetes benchmark, which contains up-to-date and industry-standard best practices? \n* Does it detect vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster with no need for manual effort from your team? You should be able to see where you have Kubernetes images with vulnerabilities and where those images are deployed.  \n\n## CIEM and IAM: Access management   \n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is an essential component of cloud-native applications security specific to the CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) part of the platform. With complex cloud environments, keeping track of users and services, their different access levels, and what impact certain permissions have can become challenging.  \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to, but not limited to, the following aspects:  \n\n* Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making them more difficult to manage  \n* Cloud-native software may run across multi-cloud environments as well as on-premises  \n* The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing identities at the service level \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to better secure their cloud in terms of identity and access management.   \n\n## Best practices regarding IAM:  \n\n* Implement multi-factor authentication for all users. This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification  \n* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity  \n* Comply with the Least Privilege Principle to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary for the user to do their job  \n* Assign permissions at group level and assign well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches.  \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP identify any drifts from your company’s security or compliance posture using a powerful IAM dashboard that pinpoints users with issues, such as the ones that do not have MFA enabled? \n* Does the CNAPP give you an understanding of your password policies and identify if users have old passwords? \n* Does it help you understand if users or groups have more permissions than necessary? \n* Does the CNAPP support you in performing effective access reviews that don’t take all day and require no manual work? \n* Does it help you gain confidence in your organization’s security posture? \n\n## Compliance  \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their compliance journey. The CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet the requirements of various compliance frameworks.   \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to perform assessments in preparation for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards a CNAPP should provide support for are are:  \n\n* ISO 27001   \n* SOC 2  \n* GDPR  \n* PCI-DSS  \n* HIPAA  \n* NIST \n\nOther standards like DORA are becoming increasingly important for some sectors, and there are regional equivalents of some regulations like Brazil’s LGDP data protection laws. \n\n### Key considerations and questions: \n\n* Does the CNAPP help you track your compliance progress in real-time and ensure you are able to understand how your organization is doing in terms of compliance posture? \n* Does the CNAPP keep a track record of your efforts that can be presented during an audit? \n* Are all of your organization's cloud resources tracked in one place, so you know that the compliance assessment is comprehensive and accurate and you're not missing anything? \n* Can you view your compliance score at-a-glance and at any time? \n* Are you able to export detailed reports to help explain your security and compliance posture to other stakeholders or to help you make a case to the board? \n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-20 lg:pb-24 lg:pt-32 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/full-platform-tour/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">TAKE A TOUR OF CYSCALE'S CNAPP</button></a></div>\n\n## Summary: CNAPP as a critical part of cloud-native security \n\nAs cloud-native application development has penetrated the market, it has not only expanded the infrastructure estate but also the number of teams involved, from devops, to platform engineers, cloud architects, security experts, compliance practitioners, and more.  \n\nLikewise, security solutions have evolved in tandem, moving beyond the more static nature of the CSPM, to the more dynamic capabilities of a CNAPP, with an integrated, lifecycle security and compliance approach to protecting workloads and applications. \n\nThe vendor landscape is competitive and vendor portfolios have either grown through acquisition or original development. The result is that many established vendor CNAPP offerings are bolted together point solutions with little or no integration.  \n\nCloud-native organizations going down this route will need to ensure they have the resources available to learn and operate several different tools and even take on some of the work around correlation and context in cloud security.  \n\nThe main concern with challenger or incoming CNAPP vendors, on the other hand, might be a lack of maturity in the components, even though the platform itself is designed with integration in mind.  \n\nOrganizations will need to carefully assess the capabilities of the CNAPP solution to ensure it meets their specific needs, without requiring too many resources or investments, and with room for future growth.  \n\nThat said, CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions are regarded as a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, its high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient.  \n\n### C﻿hoosing a CNAPP\n\n**Overall, CNAPP solutions offer:**  \n\n1. Visibility  \n2. Compliance  \n3. Data security  \n4. Runtime protection  \n5. Container image scanning  \n6. Kubernetes cluster inspection  \n7.

It builds upon the NIS 1 Directive, which regulates network and information systems security. NIS2 was created by the European Union to enforce a modern cybersecurity strategy, having in mind new sectors and improving incident response and resilience in compliant entities. NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) came into effect on the 16th of January 2023 and replaces NIS1, which was released in 2016. \n\n## Differences between NIS 1 and NIS 2 \n\nAiming to improve the NIS1 Directive, its newer version has a few differences. Some of the key ones are: \n\n* NIS2 now covers more sectors than NIS1, which focused on essential services operators in sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, healthcare. NIS2 also has cloud computing services in scope. Some examples of the newly added sectors are postal and courier services, waste management, digital providers. \n* Security controls are more stringent for NIS2. A few topics covered for the cloud are data encryption, IAM, vulnerability management, zero trust principles, and incident response. \n* Penalties no longer differ from country to country like they did in NIS1; they are harmonized across the European Union. \n\n## Key elements of NIS2 \n\nAll entities in scope should take measures to cover the most important elements, considered by NIS2 as the baseline for protecting the network, information systems, and physical environment from cybersecurity incidents. The following are the mandatory measures: \n\n* Policies on risk analysis and information system security, \n* Incident handling, \n* Business continuity, \n* Supply chain security, \n* Security in network and information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance, \n* Policies to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk management measures, \n* Basic cyber hygiene practices and training, \n* Policies regarding the use of cryptography and encryption, \n* HR security, access control policies, access management, \n* The use of MFA or continuous authentication solutions. \n\nYou can find more details about these requirements directly from [the NIS2 directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555). \n\n\n\nThe NIS2 is crucial for implementing cybersecurity best practices and protecting critical infrastructure. Organizations can mitigate risks and contribute to a safer digital environment by adopting the mentioned requirements.  \n\n## F﻿AQ on NIS2 Directive\n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What is the goal of the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">It aims to enhance cybersecurity resilience for the EU's critical infrastructure and digital service providers.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Who does the NIS2 Directive apply to?</p><p class=\"answer\">It applies to entities that provide essential or important services to the European economy from different sectors such as energy, transportation, healthcare, finance, but not limited to those.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How does the NIS2 Directive affect cloud providers?</p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud providers must implement robust security measures to comply with the directive and protect services from cyber threats.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What happens if you don't comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">Non-compliance can lead to penalties such as fines and sanctions, along with increased cyber risks and disruptions to critical services.</p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">How can organizations comply with the NIS2 Directive?</p><p class=\"answer\">By conducting risk assessments, implementing security controls, establishing incident response procedures, and promoting cybersecurity awareness.</p></li></ul>\n\n[You can perform a free risk assessment right now](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) to see where your company stands in terms of cloud security and find out the most actionable insights that can improve your business’ cloud security posture. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Engineering","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Secrets Management in Kubernetes: Essential Insights and Best Practices","seoTitle":"Secrets Management in Kubernetes: Essential Insights and Best Practices","description":"Secrets Management is always a hot topic nowadays.

Choosing the correct encryption algorithm, storing secrets in the right service, setting access to them; these are all actions that can make it or break it for your infrastructure.   \n\nIn this article, we will not only discuss how you should manage secrets in Kubernetes, but also help you understand why all these protection measures are vital for your Kubernetes clusters. \n\n## Secrets in Kubernetes \n\nSecrets are objects that contain keys, passwords, tokens. We're talking API keys, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, and others. Hackers dream of these every day and they put all their efforts into stealing them, so why wouldn’t you do the same, but for protecting them? \n\nHowever, even if they are the crown jewel of your Kubernetes cluster, they are actually stored unencrypted on etcd. That’s right. Anyone with access to etcd, as well as anyone with API access can retrieve (or even modify) a Secret. Moreover, [according to CNCF](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), anyone who is authorized to create a Pod in a namespace can also read any Secret in the namespace. So, we’ve already found two big problems: Secrets are stored unencrypted, and a lot of users can have access to them if you’re not implementing the Least Privilege Principle (which you can read more about [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)). Let’s see how to solve these issues. \n\n## Secrets Management Checklist \n\n### At rest encryption \n\nArguably the first step to securing secrets is encrypting them. At rest encryption ensures confidentiality. This means that if attackers get ahold of your secrets, they will not be able to read them unless they decrypt them. With [good key management and an appropriate cryptographic algorithm](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/), you can keep attackers at bay. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo enable secret encryption at rest in EKS, you must: \n\n1. Navigate to the EKS console. You can click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters). \n2. Select the cluster for which you want to enable secret encryption. \n3. Under **Overview**, navigate to **Secrets Encryption** and select **Enable**. \n4. Choose a key from the drop-down list and select **Enable**. If you don’t already have a key, you must create one and return to this window. \n\nYou can also turn on secrets encryption for your Kubernetes clusters using this command: \n\n```html\naws eks associate-encryption-config --cluster-name <clusterName> --encryption-config '\\[{\"resources\":[\"secrets\"],\"provider\":{\"keyArn\":\"arn:aws:kms:<regionCode>:<account>:key/<key>\"}}]'\n```\n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo turn on KMS etcd encryption for an existing cluster, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <keyID>\n```\n\nThis enables secret encryption using a publicly reachable Azure Key Vault. It assumes you already have an encryption key and a managed identity configured to allow access to the key. [Our article](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/) explains more about Azure Key Vault and its configuration options. \n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nIn Google Cloud, Kubernetes secrets are encrypted at rest by default. However, you can turn on secrets encryption at the application layer. Here is how you can do it: \n\n1. Navigate to the Google Kubernetes Engine page in the Google Cloud console by clicking [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?_ga=2.113700551.1182343565.1709535826-1724752788.1707736657). \n2. Under **Security**, select the **Edit Application-layer Secrets Encryption** button. \n3. Select the **Enable Application-layer secrets encryption** checkbox and choose the key you want to use. \n4. Select **Save changes**. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\n1. **To begin the process of encrypting your secrets at rest**, generate an encryption key. You can use a Key Vault or a KMS to do this. Then, you need to create a configuration file. Here is an example provided by CNCF: \n\n```html\napiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: EncryptionConfiguration \n\nresources: \n\n- resources: \n\n- secrets \n\n- configmaps \n\n- pandas.awesome.bears.example \n\n    providers: \n\n- aescbc: \n\n          keys: \n\n- name: key1 \n\n              secret: <base64 encoded key> \n\n- identity: {}\n```\n\nAfter you base64-encode it, add the key as the secret value. \n\n2. Save the configuration file to /etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml on the control plane node.  \n\nDon’t forget that your configuration file contains your key. Base64 encoding adds no security, so restrict permissions over the file as much as possible. \n\n3. Edit the manifest for the kube-apiserver static pod (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml) to contain the following command: *\\--encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/enc/enc.yaml*. [Read more on the Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#write-an-encryption-configuration-file) website to see how to do this. \n\nAfter this, restart your API server to apply changes. After ensuring that all secrets are encrypted, remove the last line of the config file; “identity” allows for plaintext retrieval of secrets. \n\n### Key rotation \n\nKey management is just as important as the process of performing cryptographic operations. It doesn’t matter that your data is encrypted with the best encryption algorithm out there; if your key is leaked or stolen, an attacker can immediately decrypt your secret. So make sure to rotate your keys regularly to prevent data breaches. Let’s see how key rotation is handled in Kubernetes managed services and in self-managed clusters. \n\n**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** \n\nIf you followed the previous steps and enabled EKS secret encryption with a KMS key, rotation is very easy to setup. Navigate to the KMS service, and under **Customer managed keys**, select the key you used. Under **Key rotation**, check the checkbox and click Save. The key will now be automatically rotated every eyar. \n\n**AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** \n\nTo rotate the key in a key vault, you can use the following command: \n\n```html\naz aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --enable-azure-keyvault-kms --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access \"Public\" --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id <newKeyID>\n```\n\nRun the following command to re-encrypt secrets with the new key. \n\n```html\nkubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -\n```\n\n**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** \n\nWhen you use the Google Cloud console to create a key, Cloud KMS sets the rotation period and next rotation time automatically. You can choose to use the default values or specify different values. \n\n**Self-managed Kubernetes clusters** \n\nThese are the steps to rotate your decryption key, according to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/): \n\n1. Generate a new key securely and add it as the second entry for the current provider on all control plane nodes. Restart all kube-apiserver processes so that each server can decrypt data encrypted with the new key. \n2. Backup the new encryption key. If you lose it, you lose access to all data encrypted with it.  \n3. Make the new key the first entry in the keys array and restart all kube-apiserver processes. \n4. Run *kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -* to encrypt all secrets with the new key. \n5. Remove the old key from the configuration. \n\n### RBAC and the Least Privilege Principle \n\nNow that we’ve taken care of at-rest encryption, let’s see how to assign permissions to users securely.  \n\nTo manage permissions for secrets and for other Kubernetes objects, we recommend using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). RBAC allows you to assign fine-grained permissions with which users or groups of users can perform certain operations (such as create, read, update, or delete) on Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, services, etc. \n\n**Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings**  \n\nRoles and ClusterRoles are two kinds of Kubernetes objects that describe the permissions users are given if they have that role. The basic Role sets the permissions over an object or a set of objects within a specific namespace, while the ClusterRole spans across all namespaces of the cluster. Below, you can see an example of a Role: \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: Role \n\nmetadata: \n\n  namespace: default \n\n  name: pod-reader \n\nrules: \n\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]  \n\n  resources: [\"pods\"] \n\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"] \n```\n\nA ClusterRole would simply have “kind: ClusterRole”, and no namespace specified. \n\nNotice how this is a role definition and not a policy; it’s not assigned to any user or group of users. Here come into play RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings. These objects form the relation between a role and a user or a group of users. RoleBindings grants the permissions defined in the Role object, and ClusterRoleBindings binds ClusterRoles to users or groups across the entire Kubernetes cluster. \n\nYou can also reference a ClusterRole in a RoleBinding! This way lets you define a set of common rules across your entire cluster, ensuring consistency across namespaces. Be careful though to not grant users more permissions than necessary by using the ClusterRole. \n\n[This is an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#restrictions-on-role-creation-or-update) of a ClusterRole, assigned to the user “dave” in the “development” namespace using a RoleBinding. \n\n```html\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 \n\nkind: RoleBinding \n\nmetadata: \n\n  name: read-secrets \n\n  namespace: development \n\nsubjects: \n\n- kind: User \n\n  name: dave  \n\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io \n\nroleRef: \n\n  kind: ClusterRole \n\n  name: secret-reader \n\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\nAlways remember to assign the minimum permissions necessary. This minimizes the attack surface and prevents privilege escalation in case one of your pods or users is compromised. To follow the Least Privilege Principle and protect your secrets, keep in mind the following best practices for Kubernetes: \n\n* Assign only the specific permissions you want a user to have. Instead of using wildcard (*) permissions, which may result in overly privileged roles, specify the verbs of the actions they’re allowed to perform, \n* Assign roles at the namespace-level rather than at cluster-level, to give users privileges only for the namespaces they use, \n* Perform regular access reviews to ensure everything is functioning correctly and users are not accessing resources they shouldn’t, \n* Monitor your Kubernetes cluster constantly to identify suspicious behaviour. \n\n### **Centralized Secrets Store providers** \n\nBy using a cloud Secrets Store solution, you can centralize secrets management and leave the storage, auditing, logging to the cloud provider. Moreover, if you integrate your Kubernetes cluster within the cloud using a managed solution (like EKS, AKS, GKE), you obtain a unified infrastructure. \n\nTo understand how much better Secrets Stores are, let’s look at the available solutions on the market.  \n\n**AWS Secrets Manager** is a centralized and secure solution for storing, managing, and rotating secrets. It offers fine-grained access control using AWS IAM, automatic rotation of secrets, secure storage, and monitoring capabilities. It is integrated with Kubernetes, allowing you to access secrets at runtime. AWS Secrets Manager keeps secrets encrypted at rest and sends them securely over SSL. \n\nBy using a managed solution, the pressure on developers decreases, allowing them to focus on their tasks. \n\n**Azure Key Vault** is a Secrets Store for secrets, cryptographic keys and certificates. It has advanced safety and recovery options, two permission models, and data plane and control plane separation. You can read more about Azure Key Vault [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/azure-key-vault-explained/). Azure Key Vault integrates seamlessly with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure services. \n\n**Google Cloud Secret Manager** is Google Cloud’s version for storing secrets securely. Google Cloud Secret Manager offers a fully managed solution for storing and managing secrets, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. It provides versioning, access controls, and audit logging capabilities, ensuring the secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information. \n\nUsing the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) for Kubernetes secrets, Secrets stored in managed stores in the cloud can be treated as files mounted in Kubernetes pods, allowing for a seamless utilization of secrets with no added complexity but with maximum security. \n\nManaging secrets in Kubernetes is a critical aspect of securing your Kubernetes cluster. In this article, we’ve discussed secrets encryption at rest, RBAC, and managed Secrets Store solutions in the cloud. \n\nImplementing a comprehensive secrets management strategy is a difficult task, but one that you should not work on alone. Cyscale can detect if your Kubernetes secrets are at risk and provide remediation for any findings in no time.  \n\n[Book a demo](https://cyscale.com/request-demo/) now to see actionable insights and make use of hundreds of our security controls that constantly assess your environment, such as the following for Kubernetes: \n\n* Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles \n* Minimize access to secrets \n* Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables  \n\nMoreover, you can check out CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and CIS EKS Benchmark in our platform to see how secure your Kubernetes clusters are against attackers, with CIS AKS and CIS GKE Benchmarks arriving soon! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["News","Cloud Security"],"title":"SMEs Face Security Pressure with Too Many Tools, Not Enough Skills","seoTitle":"SMEs face security pressure with too many tools, not enough skills","description":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","seoDescription":"IT admins at 56% of SMEs are concerned about their organization’s security posture, struggling with too many tools and a shortage of skills.","date":"2024-02-29T13:31:28.294Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"sme-security-pressure-too-many-tools-not-enough-skills","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/sme-security-pressure.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png","srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/ac644/sme-security-pressure.png 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/89b47/sme-security-pressure.png 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/d6cae/sme-security-pressure.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/913d0/sme-security-pressure.webp 205w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/91660/sme-security-pressure.webp 410w,\n/static/932d8a07f2fcd720319c86b63f32a7cd/888e2/sme-security-pressure.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"Security concerns are on the rise as the greatest challenge for IT admins at SMEs in Q1 2024, with 56% revealing that they’re more concerned about their organization’s security posture today than they were in April 2023.  \n\nAccording to [JumpCloud’s Q1 2024 SME IT Trends report](https://jumpcloud.com/resources/q1-2024-it-trends-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes), which surveyed IT stakeholders in UK, US, and India, the implication is that SMEs could be more vulnerable to cyber-attack than other segments. The report highlighted concerns over security amid a shortage of specialist skills and additional pressure on IT teams around compliance, with over two-thirds (75%) saying that more compliance and regulation requirements have been mandated in their region. \n\nThese concerns are backed up by long term trends in compliance. The International Organization for Standardization, which maintains the framework for ISO27001, said in its most recent report that certifications for ISO27001 increased 51% between 2020 to 2022 as more companies bowed to pressure from their own customers to prove security hardening and compliance.  \n\n## AI adoption is adding fuel to the fire \n\nWhile AI is seen by some as a cost-effective way of plugging the skills gap left by sweeping layoffs and a general lack of experienced professionals in specific sectors (such as security and cloud), IT admins tasked with integrating AI appear less confident, JumpCloud found.  \n\nDespite a mostly positive attitude toward AI in their organization, admins also report significant unease around AI’s impact on organizational security, with nearly two-thirds (62%) agreeing that AI is outpacing their organization’s ability to protect against threats overall. \n\n## Too many tools to be effective\n\nAnother challenge, compounded by a lack of manpower to carry out tasks, is that IT admins find themselves juggling too many tools to do their job.  \n\nThe vast majority (75%) of global respondents continue to prefer a single tool for a specific job rather than several-point solutions, roughly the same as the 77% who said the same in April 2023.  \n\n## MSPs come out on top \n\nBut this is all good news for Managed Service Providers, which continue to be a go-to resource for organizations under pressure.  \n\nNearly 76% rely on an MSP for at least some features and the trend is that organizations are leaning on MSPs for increased responsibilities, where SMEs are lacking the skills or the tools, or the ability to use the tools effectively.  \n\nThe survey found that an MSP completely manages the IT environment for 42% of respondents in UK, US, and India, versus 27% in April 2023—a 56% increase over 12 months. \n\nTellingly, security is the most common function for which organizations use MSPs (57% in 2024 versus 53% in April 2023), and the most popular reason why is that SMEs believe MSPs are up to date on the latest technologies (65%, up from 61% in April 2023), suggesting that smaller organizations are plugging the skills gap for complex subjects like security, cloud, and AI, with outsourcing.  \n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            Unlock New Revenue Streams With<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale Cloud Security for MSPs</span> \n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-security-mssp/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div> \n\n## Aggregation of tools and automation as the solution \n\nThese trends that JumpCloud has highlighted in the SME sector align closely with what we are hearing from the market and our own SME customer base.\n\nWhen it comes to cloud security specifically, IT admins and security professionals are struggling with multiple point solution tools that only apply to a single ecosystem. The cloud provider security tools only work for their own cloud, and skills for managing and securing that cloud are not transferable to another cloud either. This leaves SMEs struggling to meet security and compliance requirements and potentially losing business as a result.  \n\nSo, it comes as no surprise to see MSPs as the winners here. When small and medium businesses cannot get the skills in-house, but are seeing growing compliance pressures, they have no choice but to outsource the problem. What’s interesting is that MSPs and MSSPs face the same challenge, because the skills shortage is industry wide. But we work with a large number of managed service providers to help them unify their cloud security tools into a single platform and use automation to augment the security skills of their analysts to be transferable across all clouds and containerized environments. This means they can serve more customers with the same resources.\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Unifies Multiple<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cloud Security</span> Tools\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","seoTitle":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","description":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","seoDescription":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","date":"2024-02-27T14:48:18.017Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"container-escaping-leaky-vessels-docker-vulnerability","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/41be8/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/c78f7/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/913d0/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/91660/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/888e2/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"New vulnerabilities revealed in the runc command line tool could be exploited to allow attackers to escape containers and potentially get unauthorized access to the host operating system and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.  \n\n## What are the Leaky Vessels vulnerabilities? \n\nOn the 31st of January 2024, Snyk revealed four Docker container vulnerabilities with a critical security score ranging between 8.6 and 10. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).
