Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn GCP, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn GCP, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![GCP IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.png#shadow \"GCP IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n[In the following article](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), we will look at best practices described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Manuela Țicudean","categories":["Product"],"title":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","seoTitle":"How Alert Fatigue Adds to the Pressure on Cybersecurity Teams","description":"The pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles.

They are the defenders, the guardians of our digital fortresses. However, as much as we rely on these experts to keep us safe, we must also acknowledge the pressure on their demanding roles. One particular challenge that exacerbates this pressure is alert fatigue. In this article, we'll explore the impact of alert fatigue on cybersecurity teams. \n\n### The Cloud Security Manager's Struggle \n\nMeet Anna, a cloud security manager who works tirelessly alongside infrastructure teams to ensure the security of their organization's cloud environment. Anna's team is using several security services offered by their cloud provider, designed to detect and notify them of potential vulnerabilities and [cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/). However, this seemingly invaluable tool comes with its own set of challenges. \n\n#### The False Positive Conundrum  \n\nOne of the frustrations Anna encounters is the influx of false positives generated by all the security services they use. Imagine her having to provide an auditor with a report showcasing hundreds of errors in bold red, when not all of them are truly relevant to the organization's security posture. It can be a daunting and time-consuming task to sift through the noise and identify the true threats that require immediate attention. This constant barrage of false positives can quickly lead to alert fatigue. \n\n#### Relevance Matters \n\nNot all alerts are created equal, and Anna understands this all too well. Different teams within an organization have varying responsibilities, and therefore, their focus areas differ. For instance, a developer may not be interested in an alert regarding rotating keys, as this falls within the purview of infrastructure or security teams. On the other hand, an alert about a database vulnerability would definitely catch the developer's attention, if they were the ones responsible for its maintenance and security. Tailoring alerts to each team's specific needs and priorities is crucial to avoid overwhelming individuals and contributing to alert fatigue. \n\n#### The Weight of Alert Fatigue  \n\nAlert fatigue is a real phenomenon that cybersecurity teams experience on a regular basis. The constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming. Anna aptly describes the feeling when she says, \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\" It's a moment of panic, a sense of being buried under an avalanche of warnings, all of which demand attention. The strain it puts on cybersecurity teams can be immense, leading to increased stress levels and reduced overall efficiency. \n\n### Contextual Analysis to the Rescue \n\nFortunately, there is light at the end of the tunnel for cybersecurity teams like Anna's. Innovative solutions, such as [contextual analysis](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) tools, are emerging to address the challenges of alert fatigue. These tools leverage advanced algorithms to analyze and prioritize alerts based on contextual information, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues with the highest impact on their organization's security posture. Contextual analysis helps filter out false positives and, together with the ability to tailor alerts to the relevant stakeholder, this helps alleviate alert fatigue and enables teams to work more effectively. \n\nThe pressure on cybersecurity teams is intense, and alert fatigue adds an extra layer of stress to their already demanding roles. Acknowledging the real impact of alert fatigue is crucial, as it allows us to seek out [solutions](https://cyscale.com/) that can alleviate this burden. With contextual analysis tools we can empower cybersecurity teams to navigate the sea of alerts more efficiently. By reducing false positives, tailoring alerts to specific teams, and prioritizing the most critical issues, we can help alleviate alert fatigue and support our cybersecurity heroes in their mission to keep our digital world safe."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1.
