Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn GCP, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn GCP, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![GCP IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.png#shadow \"GCP IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n[In the following article](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), we will look at best practices described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","description":"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Technology Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines is a set of principles and best practices destined for financial institutions, meant to regulate risk management and assessment, access control, incident management, software application development, and others.

Technology Risk Governance and Oversight \n2. Technology Risk Management Framework \n3. IT Project Management and Security-by-Design \n4. Software Application Development and Management \n5. IT Service Management \n6. IT Resilience \n7. Access Control \n8. Cryptography \n9. Data and Infrastructure Security \n10. Cyber Security Operations \n11. Cyber Security Assessment \n12. Online Financial Services \n13. IT Audit \n\nThese sections contain subsections that describe in detail the best practices that should be followed for each area covered by that section.  \n\nIt is important to note that MAS TRM Guidelines does not contain any specific controls, and it is up to the organization to create and tailor controls to fulfill each section's recommendations. \n\nIn this article, we will look in detail at the sections that may apply for cloud environments and understand the requirements. \n\n## IT Resilience  \n\nThis section describes the importance of: \n\n* Availability,  \n* Recoverability, \n* Disaster recovery, \n* Backups,  \n* Data centre resilience. \n\n**Availability** ensures users can access data without interruption. High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 268 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\n<img src=\"/img/33_blog-mas-standard.png\" alt=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","seoTitle":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","description":"Along with the new year come new resolutions.

Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing which framework is suitable for you and becoming compliant is not an easy task.  \n\nCyscale can help you ease the process of becoming NIST compliant. Using our Standards page, you can track your progress and speed up the process in terms of your cloud-specific needs. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-standards.png\" alt=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" title=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product"],"title":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","seoTitle":"Introducing the New Data Security Dashboard!","description":"We have released a new, powerful Data Security Dashboard to provide visibility in the cloud.

The Dashboard displays information about: \n\n* Encryption, \n* The management of cryptographic keys, \n* Publicly accessible storage assets such as VMs, databases, [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/), and others, \n* Databases and misconfigurations related to them, \n* Containers such as blobs and buckets that may vulnerable, and others. \n\nThese DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities enable users to detect attack paths for data storage assets and quickly mitigate them.  \n\nThe first section of the dashboard shows us the percentage of storage assets that are:  \n\n* unencrypted,  \n* encrypted with provider-managed-key, and  \n* encrypted with CMK (Customer Managed Key).  \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-progress-card.png\" alt=\"Progress card for encryption status\" title=\"Progress card for encryption status\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nThis card is a good indicator of progress, and, by clicking on each section of the status bar, we see which assets fit in each of those states. Using this feature, you are at a click away from finding out which of your storage cloud assets are unencrypted. \n\nThe next section contains the Publicly Accessible card, which provides visibility over a multitude of assets, as you can see in the image below. When you click on each element, you see a list of affected assets, along with the associated risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-second-image.png\" alt=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" title=\"Publicly accessible cloud assets\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at this feature in more detail to understand how this helps secure your cloud infrastructure. \n\nThe “**Readable Object Containers**” and “**Writable Object Containers**” refer to storage assets such as [buckets](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) and blobs. Object containers should not be publicly accessible unless it is necessary, since individuals could then read or overwrite possibly sensitive data without having to perform any kind of authentication or authorization. \n\nThe next item in this section highlights **database instances that have public IP addresses**. Databases should be configured with private IP addresses to reduce attack surface and increase security. \n\nThe last items in this list are publicly accessible: \n\n* **queues**,  \n* **encryption keys**, and  \n* **disks**.  \n\n[Cloud queues](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-queues-security-best-practices/) act like buffers to prevent data loss when services are too busy and cannot process incoming messages, and therefore should not be publicly accessible to prevent data leakage or data tampering. The control regarding encryption keys checks for attached policies that may allow public access to the key. The other control ensures there are no disks attached to VMs reachable from the internet. \n\nThe next card on the Data Security Dashboard provides an overview of the [encryption keys](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) used in your cloud infrastructure. Cryptographic key management is a very important but sometimes overlooked aspect of the encryption process.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-encryption-keys.png\" alt=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" title=\"Cryptographic key management in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nCyscale checks if the encryption keys are stored on a vulnerable VM or if they have a permissive access policy to identify possible attack paths. Moreover, important information is highlighted, such as: \n\n* keys that are in use and are scheduled for deletion, \n* keys that haven’t been rotated in a long time, and \n* keys that will expire soon. \n\nThe next two sections in this dashboard focus on object containers, such as buckets or blobs, and on [databases](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/). Here, you can see some of the categories of vulnerabilities Cyscale has identified and checked your cloud environment against.  \n\nThe first card presents the state of your object containers. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-publicly-accessible-assets.png\" alt=\"Object containers with issues\" title=\"Object containers with issues\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUsing this feature, we identify attack paths that may compromise your cloud assets and help you solve them. \n\nFor example, a common attack is exploiting VMs that have open management ports. If you have a VM that has permissions on a bucket, and that VM is compromised, your bucket may be compromised as well.  \n\nUsing the [Cyscale Knowledge Graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/), you can see that the VM named \"sql-instance\" has an instance profile that gives it full access to the bucket on the far right, and the VM also has port 22 (SSH) open. The VM is thus connected to the internet and therefore puts the data stored in the bucket at risk. \n\n<img src=\"/img/cyscale-article-image-14-min.png\" alt=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph highlighting an attack path\" title=\"Cyscale Knowledge Graph\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nOther critical issues highlighted for object containers include: \n\n* Enabling public access to storage assets, \n* Having an overly-permissive access policy,  \n* Not enabling versioning, and others. \n\nClicking on “Object containers with public access”, we get a list of misconfigured assets as well as details like: \n\n* Connectors, which represents the cloud or identity provider account, \n* Tags,  \n* Risks. \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_32-second-to-last.png\" alt=\"List of misconfigured assets\" title=\"List of misconfigured assets\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nMoving on to the databases card, using controls, Cyscale checks for the following misconfigurations: \n\n* **Databases with public IP addresses,** \n* **Databases with outdated engine versions,** \n* **Databases without deletion protection,** \n* **Databases with no encryption,** \n* **Databases with no/old TLS.** \n\n<img src=\"/img/blog_32-databases-last.png\" alt=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" title=\"Databases with issues in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nUse the multitude of features present in the Cyscale Data Security Dashboard to eliminate data exposure through [data storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/).
