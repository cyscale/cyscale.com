Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn Google Cloud, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![Google Cloud IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.webp#shadow \"Google Cloud IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\nIn the following article, we will look at [IAM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-identity/) described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","seoTitle":"Container Escaping with Leaky Vessels: A New Docker Vulnerability with 8.6 Severity ","description":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","seoDescription":"Vulnerabilities in the runc CLI tool could allow attackers to escape containers and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.","date":"2024-02-27T14:48:18.017Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"container-escaping-leaky-vessels-docker-vulnerability","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg","srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/41be8/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/c78f7/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/2c0f5/leaky-vessels-container-escape.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/913d0/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 205w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/91660/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 410w,\n/static/05f06f8d8982982a16b18b6104ea387f/888e2/leaky-vessels-container-escape.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"tableOfContents":false},"rawMarkdownBody":"New vulnerabilities revealed in the runc command line tool could be exploited to allow attackers to escape containers and potentially get unauthorized access to the host operating system and move laterally though a Kubernetes or cloud environment.  \n\n## What are the Leaky Vessels vulnerabilities? \n\nOn the 31st of January 2024, Snyk revealed four Docker container vulnerabilities with a critical security score ranging between 8.6 and 10. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and escape containers, gaining access to the underlying instance and possibly compromising secrets and other resources.  \n\nAn attacker exploiting an orchestration-based setup utilizing runc, such as Kubernetes, could execute a breakout onto the underlying Kubernetes node. In multi-tenant environments, pods from different tenants can share nodes, meaning a breakout could lead to unauthorized access to other pods belonging to other tenants. \n\nThe vulnerabilities affect runc, a container runtime, and Buildkit, a builder for docker: \n\n* [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) \n* [CVE-2024-23651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23651) \n* [CVE-2024-23653](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23653) \n* [CVE-2024-23652](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23652) \n\nCVE-2024-21626, which affects runc, has a severity of 8.6. It occurs in runc versions 1.1.11 and earlier, so updating the CLI tool to version 1.1.12 would patch this vulnerability. \n\n## How does the Leaky Vessels exploit work? \n\nBy leveraging the “WORKDIR” command, the attacker can spawn a new process and have a working directory in the host’s filesystem. This can be done either by running a malicious image or by building a container image using a malicious Dockerfile. These two attacks can also be used to overwrite host binaries, thus escaping the container. \n\nContainer escape elevates the attackers’ privileges and opens up other possibilities; by having access to the underlying system of a container, a hacker can access files and secrets on the host and even move laterally to compromise other systems. \n\n<img src=\"/img/vulnerability-cyscale-leaky-vessels.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## How do you fix it? \n\nTo determine if this vulnerability exists in your cloud or Kubernetes environment, you can [start a free risk assessment with Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/).

Now you can also see **what**.  \n\n## Why are non-human identities important? \n\nNearly 90% of organizations routinely provide access privileges to non-humans, and 50% admit they have granted inappropriate access to non-humans*. But a similar number (54%) also revealed that inappropriate access granted to a non-employee or non-human has resulted in severe incidents, such as lost control of resources, data loss, and direct security breaches.    \n\n## Non-humans run the cloud \n\nIt’s become widely accepted that to effectively use the cloud, you need to trust non-human identities with access to resources and data in your environment. Such identities include service accounts used by applications, services, and third-party vendors. \n\nBut we frequently encounter environments among our own customer base with a non-human identity attached to a machine that has high or inappropriate privileges, is publicly accessible from the internet, and has a vulnerability.  \n\nAny attacker capable of exploiting that identity will be able to move laterally in the environment. \n\n## But humans use the cloud \n\nWhile it’s well established that [IAM (Identity and Access Management) plays an important role in a company’s security and compliance posture](https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/), and most organizations have specific policies in place so that the process of handling identities and access is well documented and manageable, the life of a CISO, CTO, or security analyst gets more difficult if they need to go into more depth. \n\nLet’s say you have an employee that’s leaving in a month, and you need to see a list of all the resources they have access to? Or you discover some unusual logs on one of your VMs and need to know who has access to it? These questions are not so easy to answer from your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud console. \n\n<div class='grid grid-cols-12 mt-12 gap-2'>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-permissions.png\" alt=\"Inventory display of assets accessible to user\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n  <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6'>\n    <img src=\"/img/inventory-accessible.png\" alt=\"Inventory view of database access control\" class=\"rounded-md\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 0;\" />\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n            See How Cyscale Helps Protect <span id=\"font-gradient\">Human and Non-Human</span> Identities\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='https://cyscale.com/products/ciem/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Cloud identity management is hard \n\nPopular security tools offered by the public cloud providers suffer from two main problems:  \n\n**1a)** They don’t really support comprehensive identity and access management functionality at all. They display users, roles, policies other IAM related entities, up to Permissions but that’s where they draw the line. The result is that you can’t state “User X has access to Resources A, B and C”.  \n\n**1b)** Let’s not even get started with non-human identities where a resource can use a service identity to access another resource.  \n\n **2)** They’re not meant specifically for this use case and require mastering some tools and languages beforehand such as Azure Resource Graph.  \n\nThis particular challenge is compounded by multi-cloud environments because the tools and the skills to use them, are not cross compatible.  \n\nLet’s say you’ve decided to go for the in-house tools from cloud providers and that you have an identity provider that helps you provision your users, groups and roles in your AWS and Azure environments. At this point, the users will receive access to both clouds.  \n\nSo, this means that managing identities will require two distinct sets of skills: both familiarity with the AWS IAM Access Analyzer and skills for easily getting from policies to resources AND knowledge of the query language used by Azure for exploring its Resource Graph.  \n\nOf course, there’s the alternative of using CLI tools to perform this analysis. There are even some great open-source tools to help you achieve the goal. However, this approach has its own limitations, like any CLI tool, and, if you’d like to go more in depth and see how the accessibility of a resource can impact other parts of the infrastructure, your journey stops there. \n\n## Managing human and non-human identities in Cyscale \n\nOur updated Identity dashboard now gives you an overview of the identities of your workloads across compute services (VMs, serverless, containers) and deep dive options to better understand the permissions, both human and non-human, when necessary, so you can now see: \n\n* A simplified view for each asset in your inventory, which tells you: \n* Who / What can access that asset  \n* What other resources can be accessed by that asset as a machine or non-human identity \n\n<img src=\"/img/identity-dashboard-service-accs.png\" alt=\"The Cyscale Identity dashboard\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:90%;height:auto;\"/>\n\n\\*﻿\\*SailPoint: <https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/survey-finds-non-employee-and-non-human-identities-leading-to-major-security-issues/>\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security"],"title":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","seoTitle":"Multi-Cloud Security: What CISOs & CTOs Need to Know ","description":"While multi-cloud gives several advantages, be careful not to compromise on security and visibility, giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights.

It’s not always by choice \n\nA multi-cloud strategy can combine the best of two (or more!) worlds, allowing cloud-native organizations to choose best-of-breed options for building apps and storing data in the cloud. At least this is true when the multi-cloud approach is by design.  \n\nIt’s not unheard of for a multi-cloud approach to happen by accident. Along with [mergers and acquisitions that force two IT estates together](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/), so-called ‘shadow IT’ is a significant problem – where teams make use of an unapproved solution resulting in a complex cloud infrastructure that spans across different cloud vendors.  \n\nWhile [multi-cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-tools-multi-cloud/) companies can gain numerous advantages - each public cloud has its own strengths - the downsides should not be disregarded, especially if they mean compromising on security and visibility and giving the CISO or CTO sleepless nights. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of multi-cloud \n\nCTOs in cloud-native businesses typically choose multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba, and others, to maximize the potential of their tech stack and access a broader range of features. Azure is known for its tight integration with other Microsoft products, AWS has strong support for general enterprise compute and storage, while Google Cloud has sought to differentiate with a focus on Machine Learning. The latest battleground is on AI and LLM support.  \n\nBut companies with legacy infrastructure, or those in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, may also have on-premises assets as well, resulting in a hybrid mix of private and public cloud infrastructure. \n\n### Key reasons to consider a multi-cloud approach: \n\n* **Flexibility:** Since you have access to multiple cloud providers, you can choose the service that best suits your needs out of a pool of options. For example, if you want to store data in a storage asset, you don’t necessarily have to go with a bucket from AWS; you can also consider a storage account in Azure or weigh out your options based on integration with other software, pricing variables, or even geography.  \n* **Optimizing costs:** Although broadly speaking, different clouds stack up in a like-for-like comparison, there are subtle but important differences in how each provider does things and charges for them. So, the flexibility of choosing services from different providers allows organizations to optimize costs effectively, avoiding unnecessary expenses and ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. \n* **Redundancy and high availability:** Distributing data across multiple cloud platforms ensures high availability and redundancy. If one provider experiences downtime or disruptions, data remains accessible from alternative sources, minimizing the risk of service interruptions. \n* **Geo-location options:** By distributing data across vendors, you can be closer to end-users from all around the world, reducing latency and improving overall user experience. Moreover, for data sovereignty reasons, you can also ensure compliance with various standards that may require that data stays inside a particular country or geographical location. This is a particularly important consideration in regulated sectors but can just as easily apply to any company that deals with customer data – which is pretty much every company. The EU’s GDPR privacy regulation is a prime compliance example, and the US is catching up now with state-specific considerations, like California’s CCPA.  \n\n## Risks and downsides of multi-cloud \n\n* **Added complexity:** An infrastructure that spans across cloud vendors is inherently more complex and more challenging to manage and secure. This is a daunting task for any CTO and engineering team. Each cloud provider has its own naming conventions, service structures, deployment models, API endpoints, and more, meaning both engineering and security professionals often forget best practices for each specific service, which can and will introduce security gaps in the company. \n* **Reduced visibility:** This is a big one. There is no security without [visibility](https://cyscale.com/blog/provide-visibility-in-cloud-okta-integration/) in the cloud, after all, you can’t secure what you can’t see. And something that’s less obvious but even more important in the cloud is context. When you can’t see all your assets, you can’t understand the relations between them and how a misconfiguration on one asset affects another. This also goes for users (both human and non-human identities) and their permissions. Without comprehensive visibility and inventory, you cannot identify vulnerabilities and gaps in your security.  \n* **The need for cloud-specific skills:** Being an expert in Azure does not directly translate to AWS and vice-versa. Same with any other cloud. All vendors have different assets, each with their own technologies, settings, security best practices, even naming conventions.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             See How Cyscale Helps Protect<br class=\"hidden lg:block\"/> Your <span id=\"font-gradient\">Multi-Cloud Estate</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Show me\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n## Making multi-cloud work and keeping your estate protected \n\nSo, how do you leverage the advantages of multi-cloud and keep the downsides of having to manage and secure a multi-cloud environment under control? Let’s look at some best practices along with actionable insights to enhance data security in multi-cloud deployments. \n\n### 1. Achieve visibility of your multi-cloud estate \n\nContinuous visibility is the first step to securing a multi-cloud infrastructure. To achieve this, centralize an inventory of your clouds in one single place using a [CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform). Having one or two dashboards that showcase your entire inventory across cloud service providers is more manageable and gives you an integrated picture versus switching tabs and constantly having to look up resources in each specific cloud console or portal.  \n\n### 2. Continuous monitoring to keep up with your clouds \n\nMonitoring goes hand in hand with visibility. By ensuring continuous logging and monitoring, your security team can identify suspicious behavior in real-time, and be aware of what’s happening in the cloud. Sudden spike in resource usage or anomalous behavior? Time to investigate. Centralize logs to have everything in one place and obtain a comprehensive view of the cloud. \n\n### 3. Achieve and maintain compliance with international frameworks \n\nInternational standards and laws like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA enforce security requirements that are meant to prevent data breaches within companies. By becoming compliant with such frameworks, you're not only strengthening your organization's cloud security posture but also showing customers that you're making efforts toward securing their data. In fact, even as the cloud skills gap has increased, so has the expectation of provable security. ISO saw an increase of 51% in ISO 27001 certifications between 2020 and 2022, as more buyers demand compliance from suppliers. Compliance applies across all security providers, and multi-cloud companies are not exempted. You should use a CNAPP to track your efforts and ace your audits by showing comprehensive reports that demonstrate your ongoing efforts. \n\n### 4. Prioritize cloud resources to optimize security efficiency  \n\nSegment your assets based on their criticality to business operations and data sensitivity. Identify the core components that, if compromised, could have severe consequences for your organization. By categorizing assets, you establish a hierarchy that guides the allocation of security resources and efforts, and in a world where both cloud and cyber skills are in short supply, optimizing your efforts is key. A CNAPP tool can help perform this prioritization based on the severity of existing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as how many other assets a cloud resource impacts or is related to. This can make the difference between a quick fix in a typical workday or a data breach that can cost a company a fortune in remediation, fines, or reputational damage.  \n\n### 5. Use automation to make security teams more efficient \n\nDepending on the skills and human resources available to you, some CTOs and CISOs might be able to easily accomplish the things we’ve discussed in a simple cloud environment, while those with reduced resources might struggle already. But there’s no denying that when you introduce another cloud provider (or two) into the discussion, a manageable manual workload quickly turns into an overwhelming mountain. For example, access reviews in a multi-cloud infrastructure are nearly impossible to do traditionally; you would have to go back and forth between identity providers and clouds and assess each permission at a time. Not only is this a very tedious job that creates lots of room for mistakes, it’s the soul-destroying kind of task that stops security teams doing work they find enriching and putting them on the lookout for other opportunities.  \n\nModern cloud security solutions such as a CNAPP however, aggregate all this information in one place, making your people more efficient, and suddenly applying the Least Privilege Principle no longer seems daunting.  \n\n## Overcoming the complexity of multi-cloud  \n\nThe complexities introduced by added infrastructure layers, each with their own approaches, and the need for cross-cloud expertise demand a proactive approach to security. While multi-cloud environments promise significant opportunities, it is important to address the associated risks, especially those related to complexity, reduced visibility, and the evolving skill set requirements. In this case, prevention really is better than cure, but as with all security, some ‘cure’ is inevitable.  \n\nWith a lack of cloud experience and cyber skills on the market, cloud native organizations should really be looking at CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)-type solutions to enhance and augment existing human resources and skills with the aim of achieving a robust cloud security posture in a multi-cloud setup. \n\n[Cyscale’s CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/full-platform-tour/) is the only tool of its kind that has been designed to be deployed and used by smaller teams, helping the CTO or CISO and your security team gain the confidence to acquire visibility, prioritize assets, ace audits for compliance benchmarks, and perform other operations that actually serve the business, rather than endless firefighting across the multi-cloud estate.  \n\n\n<div class='mt-16 rounded-tl-2xl rounded-b-2xl grid grid-cols-12 gap-4 bg-zircon py-8 px-4 lg:py-4' style='borderTopRightRadius: 3rem'>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-2'>\n        <div class='flex justify-center'>\n            <img src='/img/cloud-icon-widget.svg' alt='' id='img-text-button' />\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-6 flex items-center justify-center'>\n         <p class='font-montserrat font-bold' id=\"paragraph-text-button\">\n             Take a Tour of<span id=\"font-gradient\">Cyscale's CNAPP</span>Today\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class='col-span-12 lg:col-span-4 flex justify-center items-center'>\n        <a class='mx-auto bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind' href='/full-platform-tour/'>\n            <span style='padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem' class='text-white block'>\n                Start now\n            </span>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security","Cloud Native Security","CNAPP"],"title":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Data Plane vs. Management Plane, Access Roles and More","seoTitle":"Azure Key Vault Explained: Access Roles and More","description":"Azure Key Vault securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services.

And while it’s your safest bet to keep your crypto keys, certificates, and other secrets safe, it can become your worst enemy if you don’t manage it correctly. \n\n## What is Azure Key Vault? \n\nBefore we begin looking at best practices and security features of Key Vault, let’s go over the basics. \n\nAzure Key Vault is a Microsoft Azure product that securely stores secrets, certificates, and cryptographic keys and facilitates their usage by applications and services. It also allows users to manage a key's lifecycle, from key generation to destruction. \n\n*Did you know that if you create a key in a Key Vault, you can never actually see it? This is to safeguard against a human leaking the key. This also applies to imported keys.* \n\nAzure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard and Premium. The only difference between them is that Premium allows HSM protection for keys. HSM (Hardware Security Module) provides hardware security on top of the software security supplied by Azure as a fully managed, single tenant, premium safeguard. This is the most stringent security measure that can be applied to crypto keys. \n\n## Access control management in Azure Key Vault \n\nKey Vault authorization is done on two different planes: \n\n* The management plane, which allows users to delete key vaults, update access policies, and see properties, and \n* The data plane, where Key Vault objects can be added, deleted and modified. \n\nBasically, if you have access to the management plane, you can modify the cloud resource but have no access to the actual data in it. The opposite goes for the data plane, where you can make operations on the secrets, keys, and certificates but cannot, for example, add or remove access policies. You can delete a key, but not the actual key vault. \n\nNow that we know the difference between the two planes, let's look at some of the most used built-in RBAC roles for Key Vaults. Remember that Role Base Access Controls (RBAC) are used to restrict access to the network based on the user’s role. \n\n*Authorization for the data plane can be done using Azure Key Vault access policies as well as RBAC roles, but for the management plane, only RBAC roles can be used. Access policies are now considered legacy, and we recommend using RBAC.* \n\nAnd while access control policies help you define fine-grained control over objects and resources, this is not the way to go anymore. Policies are not a centralized management solution, meaning that you can’t just see and change permissions in one place; you would have to check each policy to see what a user's effective permissions are. Moreover, removing permissions can be difficult; the user no longer needs access to keys? Instead of going over one or more policies and unchecking the boxes that give them access, you can just remove their Key Vault Crypto Officer role, and you’re done! That way you don’t risk forgetting about a policy in the process. \n\nTo transition from access policies to RBAC, assess current permissions for all users, change to an RBAC permission model, establish the correct roles for them (and follow the Least Privilege Principle), assign those roles, and thoroughly test the setup. And to know which Key Vault Roles to use, keep reading this article! \n\n## Roles in Azure Key Vault \n\nManaging access control correctly and using the appropriate role for the job is good practice for cloud security. Following the Least Privilege Principle and only providing the necessary permissions are the keys to minimizing attack surfaces and giving your cloud environment the best chance against attackers. \n\nLet’s look at some of the available built-in Key Vault roles provided by Microsoft Azure. Remember that these roles only work if you've set Azure RBAC as the permission model (which is recommended). \n\n1. **Key Vault Reader**: This role provides the user with permission to read metadata of key vaults and their objects (certificates, keys, secrets). \n2. **Key Vault Administrator**: As an Administrator, you have all data plane permissions on all types of objects. \n3. **Key Vault Secrets Officer, Key Vault Certificates Officer, Key Vault Crypto Officer**: These three roles allow users to perform all actions on the type of Key Vault object the role is for, except managing permissions. So, a Key Vault Certificates Officer would have permissions on certificates, and so on. \n4. **Key Vault Secrets User, Key Vault Crypto User**: These roles are similar to the previous one but have fewer permissions. The Secrets user can see the secret contents. The Crypto user can perform cryptographic operations using the keys stored in the Key Vault. *Notice how there’s no Key Vault Certificates User? The Secrets user can also read the secret portion of a certificate with a private key, so apps use this role to retrieve certificates.* \n\nKeep in mind that users who can manage permissions over the Key Vault can grant themselves data plane permissions by modifying the access policies, so this plane segregation only goes so far. For this reason, I will once again remind you – follow the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/)! Don't give users more permissions than the bare minimum they need to do their job.  \n\nExcess privileges can be a gateway to disaster.  \n\n## Safety and recovery features in Azure Key Vault \n\nAzure Key Vault has a very useful feature called **soft-delete**. This allows for Key Vaults and Key Vault objects to remain recoverable for a period of 7 to 90 days (if no period is specified, then the default is set to 90). So, if someone accidentally deletes something, it can still be recovered within that timeframe. \n\n*Soft-delete is set to Enabled by default for new Key Vaults, and if a Key Vault has soft-delete enabled, it can never be disabled.* By design, Azure Key Vault makes it hard for users to lose their keys! \n\nBesides soft-delete, there’s also **purge protection**. This is another safety feature that goes beyond soft-delete, by preventing accidental **permanent** deletion. If you want to protect your Azure Key Vault from deletion while it is in its soft-deleted state, it ensures that no-one can delete it before the soft-delete period is over. **Once purge protection is enabled, just like soft-delete, it cannot be disabled.**  \n\nTo purge a Key Vault or a Key Vault object, you must have special permissions that are not, by default, given to any role. *The argument –enable-purge-protection can also be set to true to prevent anyone from purging a resource.*  \n\nIf this sounds all complicated, we can sum it up easily: once you delete a soft-delete-enabled Key Vault resource, it goes into the soft-delete state for a set period. If you also have purge protection enabled, you can't force delete it before that period is up. It's a layered protection model; you must go through multiple steps to delete a resource, making it as fool-proof as possible.  \n\nIn terms of backup, Azure recommends that you only backup secrets that are business critical; due to the nature of Key Vaults, the objects stored in them are already ensured availability: “Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically failover requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user”.  \n\nYou also can't back up your vault. It can be an annoyance, but you must back up each object and then restore them one by one. To do this, you download a blob containing the secret in an encrypted form, which you can then upload back in your Azure Key Vault. You have to upload it back in the same subscription to be able to use it (and, of course, in Azure Key Vault, not somewhere else). \n\n## Logging and protection in Azure Key Vault \n\nBesides following the best practices described in this article, you can also enable **Microsoft Defender for Key Vault**. This enables: \n\n* threat detection,  \n* threat intelligence,  \n* anomaly detection, and  \n* behavior analytics. \n\nAlso, don't forget about logging! Ensure to log user activity to identify suspicious behavior and obtain an audit trail to identify who accessed Key Vaults and when. \n\nYou can find all of these best practices and more in the Cyscale app, where we highlight misconfigurations and give you step-by-step instructions on configuring Azure Key Vaults correctly and keeping your secrets safe. \n\n<video width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" controls=\"\" tabindex=\"2\"><source src=\"https://d3n52qn7viv754.cloudfront.net/videos/data-security-tour.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["1117504136","120001781","2024892666","2199015418","220583031","273821743","3058837307","3355083976","3722074465","4068795820","4109069157","81406208","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
