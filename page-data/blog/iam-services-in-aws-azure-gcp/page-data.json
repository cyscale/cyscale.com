Then, we will look into IAM policies and what different cloud vendors offer for their IAM infrastructure.\n\n### Identity \n\nIdentity refers to who can authenticate (sign in) into a cloud account.  \n\nIn order to allow someone to access cloud resources, you need to ensure that the user trying to authenticate is who they claim to be. \n\nAuthentication should be implemented using technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to increase security.  \n\nAfter a user authenticates, access management is needed.  \n\nJust because a user successfully authenticated doesn’t mean that they should have full access to all the available resources. \n\n### Access management \n\nTo regulate access inside the cloud environment, strong access control policies need to be implemented. \n\nHaving groups with well-defined rules and privileges at different granularity levels is an excellent solution to manage access to cloud resources. \n\nIn this way, you do not have to assign permissions to each new user but rather add them to the appropriate group that already has the correct permissions. \n\nAccess management also refers to keeping track of users’ actions. Therefore, logging and monitoring are essential parts of IAM and should be implemented. \n\nNow that we’ve understood the purpose of IAM, let’s look at three big vendors in the cloud industry and their approach to access management: AWS Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. \n\n### IAM implementations - An industry overview \n\n### Amazon Web Services (AWS) \n\nFor access management, the IAM service provided by AWS has three types of assets: user, role and policy.  \n\nAlong with the creation of an account, an AWS account root user is created. \n\nWhen looking at [AWS Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/), we can identify 6 concepts in IAM: \n\n1. **Principal**, which represents the entity (user or application) that is trying to authenticate using an AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role. \n2. **Request**, which is made by a principal to AWS and holds information about the operation they want to perform. \n3. **Authentication**, which refers to the credentials you need, such as an access key or a username and password. \n4. **Authorization**, which refers to the permissions and policies that define what a principal can do in an account. \n5. **Actions and operations**, which must be included in policies in order to allow a principal to execute them. \n6. **Resources**, which define the objects that exist within a service and to which the principal requires access; they can be, for example, Amazon S3 buckets, IAM users, and Amazon EC2 instances. \n\n Policies define permissions and can be attached to: \n\n* users.\n* groups of users, \n* roles,\n* resources. \n\nThere are multiple types of policies that can be applied in AWS. A user can create their own custom policies or can use the ones offered by AWS.  \n\nYou can see below the different types of AWS policies, ordered from the most frequently used to the least: \n\n1. Identity-based (attached to IAM identities) \n2. Resource-based (attached to resources) \n3. Permissions boundaries (they define the highest level of permissions an identity-based policy can apply) \n4. Organization Service Control Policies (used to define the highest level of permissions an identity-based or resource-based policy can apply for account members of an organization) \n5. Access Control Lists or ACLs (are similar to resource-based policies and define which principals can access a resource) \n6. Session policies (they limit the permissions granted by identity-based policies in an AWS CLI or API session)\n\n### Google Cloud Platform\n\nIn GCP, permissions to access resources are organized into roles. To understand how IAM works in Google, we must look at the 3 IAM asset types: \n\n* **Roles**, which represent a collection of permissions \n* **Principals**, who are assigned to roles and can be: \n\n  * a Google Account, \n  * a Service Account, \n  * a Google group, \n  * a Google Workspace account, \n  * a Cloud Identity domain, \n  * all authenticated users, \n  * all users.\n* **Policies**, which define associations of principals and roles  \n* **Resources**, which are physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual assets, for example virtual machines. \n\nIn GCP, permissions cannot be applied to principals directly. Instead, principals must be assigned to roles and thus receive all the permissions allowed for that role. \n\nBelow, you can see a diagram of the IAM components found in Google Cloud. \n\n![GCP IAM Components](/img/gcp-iam.png#shadow \"GCP IAM Components\")\n\nImage source – [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) \n\n### Microsoft Azure \n\n[Azure Active Directory](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) (Azure AD) is an IAM service provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Azure AD is the identity system used to connect to Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and other SaaS applications. \n\nLet’s look at components of Azure AD: \n\n**1. Identity** \n\nAn identity is an entity that can be authenticated.  \n\nIdentities can be of the following types: \n\n* Users,\n* Groups,  \n* Applications. \n\n**2. Role** \n\nA role is a collection of permissions. \n\nAccess to Azure resources is managed by **RBAC (Role-based Access Control)**. \n\nAzure RBAC provides high granularity with four built-in roles: \n\n1. Owner (can perform all actions on all resource types) \n2. Contributor (can perform any action an owner can except managing RBAC) \n3. Reader (can perform all read actions on all resource types) \n4. User Access Administrator (can manage user access to Azure resources) \n\nOther roles are also provided for granular management of access. Moreover, custom roles can be created to cater to every organization’s needs. \n\n**3. Scope** \n\nScopes are sets of resources that define what an identity can access.  \n\nThey are important because, when you assign a role, it is crucial to only grant a principal the access they need. \n\nScopes can be: \n\n* subscriptions, \n* resource groups, \n* resources. \n\n**4. Resource** \n\nResources are manageable items available through Azure, such as virtual machines, databases, web applications and others. \n\nAccess to resources is granted by assigning: \n\n* a user, \n* a group, or \n* a Service Principal (process or application) \n\nto a specific role and a specific scope. \n\nCyscale integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and [improve its customers‘ cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/). \n\n[In the following article](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), we will look at best practices described by these vendors and how to check if your cloud infrastructure is implementing them correctly. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* Microservices, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud resources, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product","CSPM"],"title":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","seoTitle":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","description":"Alert fatigue is a phenomenon in which individuals receive an overwhelming amount of alerts and become desensitized to them.

Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.png\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
