These vulnerabilities have been assigned a CVSS score of 7.6 (the first two) and 8.6 (the third one), ranked HIGH. \n\nTo better understand how the vulnerabilities can be exploited, what the impact is on your cloud infrastructure and how they can be patched, let’s dive deeper: \n\n### What is an NGINX Ingress controller? \n\nThe ingress-NGINX controller is a [specialized load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) for Kubernetes and other containerized environments that accepts incoming traffic and routes it to Kubernetes pods. The NGINX Ingress controller is designed to be a central point of entry into a Kubernetes cluster adding a layer of abstraction to reduce routing complexity.  \n\nTo put it simply, it’s like a traffic policeman that tells all vehicles on a road where they are and are not allowed to go. \n\nAn ingress-NGINX controller is a specific implementation of an Ingress controller that uses the NGINX web server, which is known for its speed and efficiency.   \n\n### The 3 NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities in detail \n\n**CVE-2023-5043** \n\nDue to poor input sanitization, the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet can be used to inject command execution. \n\nAnnotations are key/value pairs that can be attached to Kubernetes objects in order to add additional information to those objects. In this case, the “configuration-snippet” annotation, or metadata, allows users to inject custom configuration code into the NGINX configuration file. \n\n**CVE-2023-5044** \n\nThis vulnerability occurs for the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect annotation. This annotation allows you to establish a permanent HTTP redirect (Return Code 301). As a result, the controller will redirect traffic to that path.   \n\n**CVE-2022-4886** \n\nThis issue can be exploited by someone with create or update permissions on ingress objects. By bypassing the sanitization of the field spec.rules\\[].http.paths\\[].path, an attacker can obtain the credentials of the controller. \n\nThe field allows you to specify where incoming requests to your applications should be routed based on the path in the URL. Since the input is not correctly sanitized, the attacker can specify an internal file as the path, thus obtaining access to sensitive data. \n\n### Impact of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nIngress controllers run with high privileges. By default, by having access to the credentials of the ingress controller, you have access to all secrets in the cluster. As you can imagine, the impact of these vulnerabilities left unchecked can create significant risk for your data. So, it’s no surprise that the vulnerabilities described have been assigned such high CVSS scores.  \n\n### Mitigation of the NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities \n\nTo protect your cloud environment from these vulnerabilities, follow these steps: \n\n* for CVE-2023-5043 and CVE-2023-5044, update NGINX to version 1.19 and set the --enable-annotation-validation flag, \n* for CVE-2022-4886, change the pathType attribute of the controller to Exact or Prefix. This will allow only paths that start with “/” and contain alphanumeric characters, “-“, “_”, and additional “/”.  \n\n### The impact of NGINX Ingress controller vulnerabilities on cloud environments  \n\nThe next question is, are cloud environments impacted by these vulnerabilities? Yes! Many cloud environments run Kubernetes clusters with NGINX-ingress controllers. For a cloud-native company building software that heavily relies on Kubernetes and employs ingress-controllers, there are significant risks involved. If exploited, these bugs can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the cluster. \n\nMoreover, the ingress controller manages incoming traffic, so the disruption of such a critical component of an infrastructure can cause availability issues leading to downtime and possible financial losses. \n\nCyscale customers are already protected, as the [Cyscale cloud security platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) surfaces assets affected by the NGINX Ingress controller bugs as long as their vulnerability scanner of choice has been updated."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","seoTitle":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","description":"A Hybrid Cloud infrastructure contains at least two different environments, which can be on-premises, in the public cloud and in a private cloud.

If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for Google Cloud. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","seoTitle":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","description":"Data classification is a way of grouping data to ensure easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.

Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in Google Cloud, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow Google Cloud customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your Google Cloud environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"category":"Cloud Security","seoTitle":"Cyscale - Cloud Security","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale Cloud Security","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","IAM","Misconfigurations"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
