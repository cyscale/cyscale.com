Or about security at all? Let’s zoom out even more and talk about the virtues we, as people, often desire for ourselves and look for in others. These include courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness. As Brian Tracy points out in his excellent book, “No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline”, all these virtues depend on and are guaranteed by one of them: **integrity**. Just like this, our software products have multiple requirements including functional (it must solve specific problems) and non-functional (performance, availability, efficiency, etc.). All these depend on the trust our users have in our systems to keep their data safe; they depend on **security**.\n\nIn theory, the most secure software is the one that doesn’t exist. If you have nothing, there is nothing to worry about. In practice, you will probably want to achieve certain things, to deliver certain features within a reasonable timeframe and budget. Luckily for us, the cloud providers offer a sizeable suite of services that might help us. In the era of data-driven, microservices-based, global-scale systems, we end up using some of them for compute (e.g. EC2, AKS, GKE, Lambda, Cloud Run), storage (S3), business intelligence (Redshift, Power BI), integration (Pub/Sub, Kinesis, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus), and so on. AWS even offers a service that lets you make use of their (satellite) ground stations. If you are competing with Elon’s Starlink or you are building a weather forecasting system, you might find it useful\n\n## Great Power, Great Responsibility\n\nNaturally, you must understand how to configure each cloud service you end up using and make them work together. One fundamental concept provided by the cloud is the way you manage access. You have control over both the network (so the service is actually reachable or not) and IAM (whether the clients must have identities and sufficient permissions). On one end of the spectrum, you can leave everything open and hope everyone expects that you have it properly set up. On the other end, you can choose a very restrictive configuration that might slow down your team. This is often known as the tradeoff between security and usability (for your dev team in this case). Over the past few years, the industry started shifting more toward security introducing concepts such as zero trust security and SSO (please make use of it whenever possible; also, it’s a shame that some companies still provide SSO only with their enterprise plans).\n\nClassically, you had a number of VMs (on-premises, VPS), installed and configured UFW, set up SSH access, and sent the SSH keys to your colleagues. Now, you can configure public and **private** (sub)networks, connect your cloud networks to your on-premises networks, deploy load balancers, define firewall rules without ever SSH-ing into the VMs, and assign identities and permissions to the VMs (and any other compute service). If previously your team didn’t interact too much with the infrastructure side, **now the infrastructure is part of the application**.\n\n## Network Access\n\nStarting with configuring the network access, here you have multiple options to control it. Perhaps the simplest concept is making the resources public or private. Your VM might have a vulnerable OS version, but if nothing can reach it and it cannot reach the internet, the risk is considerably lower. Not only can you run most compute and database services in a private network, but you can also configure fully managed services to be accessible through the provider's internal network (without traversing the internet) by leveraging services such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).\n\nFurthermore, you can (have to) configure firewalls. Here the services vary a bit. GCP calls them [VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls). You define them at the VPC level and can optionally choose to which instances they should apply based on tags (they are not equivalent to AWS/Azure tags. In GCP, the equivalent would be the resource labels) or service accounts (almost every resource can have an identity, which in GCP, is given by service accounts). In AWS, you work with security groups that are assigned to virtual machines. Besides allowing traffic (by default everything is denied) from certain IP addresses or CIDRs, you can also choose based on the security group of the source (please make use of this). You can also achieve this in Azure, but you have to combine two types of resources: network security groups (these are the actual firewalls) and application security groups (you can associate these with the network tags from GCP). In fact, here are the sources you can configure for each provider:\n\n* AWS: CIDRs, IP addresses, security groups, prefix lists (if you want to allow traffic coming only from certain AWS services)\n* Azure: CIDRs, IP addresses, application security groups, service tags (e.g. \\`AzureLoadBalancer\\`, \\`Internet\\`)\n* GCP: CIDRs, IP addresses, network tags (defined on each instance), service accounts\n\nOf course, this is not all. You also have network access control lists (NACLs), firewalls specific to each service (especially managed databases from Azure), NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPNs, virtual appliances, traffic splitting, firewalls that you install on the VMs, and a lot more. All these bring considerable complexity and make it extra difficult to configure the optimal **effective network access**.\n\nAdditionally, while there are tools that check the traffic in real-time, these are often dealing with network paths that you defined and are aware of. There might be paths you did not intend to leave open that an attacker might make us for **lateral movement**.\n\n## IAM Access\n\nNot only can every member of your organization have a user (or multiple) with access to certain parts of your infrastructure, but so does almost every compute resource. Just like you provide John with permission to read data from a bucket, so you assign a role to a VM achieving the same access. The difference is that anything that runs on the VM and everyone who can access it (i.e. SSH into it) now can do everything the VM can do.\n\nFundamentally, this mechanism of assigning roles to resources is excellent. You have clear visibility of the principals (users, resources) that can access a given service, you can grant or revoke access at any moment, and you have a meaningful trail of access logs. The alternative is often based on keys/secrets and is almost impossible to trace properly because anyone that has the key can access the resource (it’s easy to lose track of who has the key) (secret scanners help a bit here but are limited to the resources they run on).\n\nWe just have to understand its implications. If attackers manage to break into a VM and if that VM has high (excessive?) permissions, the attackers will not only be able to access our data, but they will also be able to spin up additional instances (crypto mining?) and delete existing resources (service disruption and data loss).\n\nAgain, here it’s important to understand the effective permissions each resource has. There are multiple factors that contribute to the effective permissions such as the role assigned to the resource, permissions inherited from group memberships or from assignments at a higher level (the VM might be an owner at the subscription level in Azure thus having access to everything in that subscription), and policies configured on the target resources such as [resource policies in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) and [access policies for Azure Key Vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/security-features).\n\nAnother important aspect about effective permissions in the context of data access is encryption, especially encryption with customer-managed keys. For example, if you store data on S3 and encrypt it with a key managed by AWS KMS, you must have access to both the S3 bucket/object and the encryption key from KMS. Managing encryption keys deserves an article on its own.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nEven if you have pristine infrastructure security, you still must provide access to someone (at least two admins so one doesn’t lock himself out by mistake - aka admin redundancy) to maintain the infrastructure and manage access for everyone else. This is an example of a highly privileged user. This in itself is not a major risk. However, if highly privileged users don’t have strong authentication mechanisms in place (MFA, preferably with strong factors), they can become liabilities. We are all subject to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n\nWhen you find out that an attacker managed to gain access to a highly privileged user, after revoking the sessions and rotating the credentials, you will want to find out the impact. For this, you need to know the systems to which the user has access. This can be quite challenging since the permissions are often spread across multiple systems.\n\nFor example, if you have Okta as the identity provider and AWS for the cloud infrastructure, you have to check both systems and link the results in order to determine what a person actually has access to. In Okta you just provide access to an application, but in AWS that application is often an AWS Organization with multiple accounts.\n\n## Ending Notes\n\nGiven all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen. However, we can go fast and build secure systems. It’s not a zero-sum game. You probably have people in your organization that are naturally passionate about security. Give them the responsibility, the training, and the tools. You probably don’t need that many people to do security full-time since the tools are getting increasingly powerful."},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","seoTitle":"Securing Your Cloud: Essential Tips for Your Business","description":"In today's digital landscape, cloud computing has become essential for organizations looking to streamline their operations and enhance their business agility.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he assessment should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* Microservices, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud resources, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time."}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
