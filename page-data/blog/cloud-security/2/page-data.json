Protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance has become paramount for professionals like Solutions Architects, CISOs, Cloud Security Researchers, DevOps Engineers, and others in the technology space tasked with ensuring transformative technologies remain secure. \n\nBut what exactly are the top cloud security challenges, and why are they a matter of pressing concern? Whether its data breaches caused by cyberattacks or vulnerabilities due to misconfiguration, cloud security threats are multifaceted and evolving, quickly outpacing our human ability to keep up. \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will explore the top 10 cloud security challenges and present a roadmap for creating a robust cloud security strategy, with real-life examples, actionable solutions, and insights to aid your journey towards a secure cloud. \n\n## Top 10 Cloud Security Challenges \n\nThe digital landscape is filled with opportunities, but it is not without its obstacles. Cloud security challenges represent significant hurdles that organizations must overcome to fully leverage the power of cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet's dive into the top 10 challenges that are shaping the conversation in 2023: \n\n### 1. Vulnerabilities in Cloud Infrastructure: \n\nThe rise of cloud computing has unveiled a plethora of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Whether it's poorly designed APIs or weak authentication protocols, these vulnerabilities are often the entry points for unauthorized access. \n\nThe famous [Equifax data breach in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) occurred due to a vulnerability in an Apache Struts framework that allowed attackers to leak data using a vulnerable API. That breach affected approximately 147 million customers. \n\n### 2. Security Threats from Hackers and Malware: \n\nHackers continually evolve their techniques to breach cloud security defenses or simply take services offline. From sophisticated malware to phishing attacks and holding services to ransom, the threats are relentless and require constant vigilance and real-time security solutions.  \n\nIn early 2023, one botnet conducted a complex DDoS attack that was able to issue between 50 and 70 million requests per second originating from different cloud providers, [according to Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/). VMs in the cloud can be both targets of DDoS attacks, as well as unwitting participants if a compromise goes undetected. \n\n### 3. Misconfigurations and Human Errors: \n\nSimple misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic data breaches and with many companies facing a complex and sprawling cloud infrastructure it’s easy to make mistakes. Human error, whether accidental or due to lack of understanding of cloud configurations, is a consistent challenge. \n\nLet’s look at a common cloud misconfiguration example: your S3 bucket, which contains sensitive data about your customers, is publicly accessible. It sounds obvious, but a simple setting - making the bucket private - can prevent someone from the Internet accessing the data. However, if you are not aware of that configuration, this simple oversight might become a significant problem for your company; this is why it is very important to continuously monitor for misconfigurations and ensure you fix any findings in a timely manner. \n\n### 4. Insider Threats and Unauthorized Access: \n\nFrom disgruntled employees to compromised credentials, insider threats pose a unique and often overlooked challenge. Rigorous access control and monitoring are essential.  \n\nMoreover, a robust offboarding process for users is important to ensure that former employees no longer have access to the company’s assets after they have left the organization. Although the process of onboarding or offboarding an employee can be tedious, there should be a well-defined set of steps to check access rights when an employee leaves the company. After all, a favorite exercise of compliance auditors is to check a list of recently departed employees against current permissions and entitlements.  \n\n### 5. Cloud Service Providers and Shared Responsibility Model: \n\nUnderstanding the shared responsibility model with cloud service providers (CSPs) like AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud is vital. The delineation of responsibilities can sometimes be blurred, leading to security gaps.  \n\nFor example, if a user thinks that the cloud provider secures a virtual machine, they might neglect:  \n\n* closing management ports such as RDP (3389) and SSH (22), \n* using network security tools (such as firewalls, access control lists, network security groups), \n* managing VM disk encryption. \n\nThis might leave the VM unprotected because of the expectation that security is ‘somebody else’s problem’. \n\n### 6. Data Breaches and Loss: \n\nProtecting sensitive data is at the heart of cloud security. Data breaches and loss due to cyberattacks, human error, or even natural disasters can have devastating effects on organizations. Having PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stolen or leaked can lead to very grave consequences for a company. \n\nIn January 2023, the American wireless network provider T-Mobile revealed that a data breach that [potentially affected 37 million accounts occurred](https://www.reuters.com/technology/t-mobile-says-investigating-data-breach-affecting-37-mln-accounts-2023-01-19/) during 2022. Names, billing addresses, emails and phone numbers were some of the data that was leaked through an API with no authorization. Immediately in the wake of the news, T-Mobile stock fell 1%, and the company is currently under investigation by the FCC which could lead to further penalties.  \n\n### 7. Non-Compliance and Legal Risks: \n\nAdhering to regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA in the cloud can be complex. Non-compliance carries both legal risks and potential damage to reputation, especially for organizations in regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare. Compliance with international standards and laws ensures that: \n\n* Your company follows current cybersecurity best practices, \n* The reputation of your company is well maintained due to the continuous efforts to remain compliant. \n\nTo understand how serious non-compliance penalties can be, HIPAA is a good example. The maximum financial penalty for a HIPAA financial is almost $2 million, while criminal penalties can put the wrong-doer in jail for up to 10 years. It’s worth noting that regulation is also trending in the direction of at fault executives being held personally accountable, including jail time, to ensure that infringements can’t be offset by profits.  \n\nOne of the worst HIPAA violation cases happened in 2008 in one of the UCLA Health System hospitals. Employees accessed celebrity patients' medical records without authorization. A settlement of $865,000 was paid by the hospital, and the employees faced disciplinary actions. In general, employee discipline only goes as far as termination of employment but in some cases, employees have done time behind bars. \n\n### 8. Security Controls and Configurations: \n\nA security control in the cloud is a measure implemented based on a recommendation, a best practice or a requirement, designed to ensure that security and compliance of cloud resources and configurations are achieved.  \n\nImplementing and managing the right security controls and configurations is critical and tools like a Cloud Security Posture Management ([CSPM) platform](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/) can be instrumental in managing these aspects effectively. Some tools, like Cyscale, go even further and visibility is greatly improved by bringing all of the security controls into one place, compared to multiple lists and dashboards of controls for each cloud provider, which can make it particularly challenging to see the big picture in the case of multi-cloud infrastructures. \n\n### 9. Endpoint Security and Real-time Protections: \n\nEndpoints are any device connected to a network. Examples of devices include desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, point of sale terminals, and others. \n\nWith the rise of IoT and mobile workforces, securing endpoints and implementing real-time protections is more important than ever and more challenging given that these endpoints are often in the possession of individuals or at not easily accessible locations. A compromised or stolen laptop belonging to a senior engineer might be a good example here.  \n\nReal-time protection allows for threat detection and rapid response to attacks as they happen, as well as data loss prevention. For example, if you detect that a suspicious identity has connected to one of your VMs in the cloud, you can quickly act and cut off that identity before it can pivot to other cloud resources in your infrastructure. \n\n### 10. Hybrid Cloud and Multi-cloud Environments: \n\nManaging security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduces complexity.  \n\nMulti-cloud setups demand the appropriate handling of various security controls specific to each cloud provider and maintaining visibility across them, while hybrid models require seamless integration and consistent policies between on-premises and public cloud assets. In both cases, the complexity of the infrastructure and policies increases, making it crucial to stay on top of your security posture. \n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive understanding of the cloud environment, robust strategies, and leveraging solutions like [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/). \n\nThe good news? These challenges aren't insurmountable. In the sections that follow, we'll explore best practices to fortify your cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Cloud Security Strategy Roadmap \n\nWhile the challenges of cloud security can seem overwhelming, having a comprehensive and strategic roadmap in place can guide your journey towards a secure cloud environment.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in [multi-cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).

The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds. As businesses move towards these multiple platforms, creating a comprehensive [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) becomes crucial.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he [cloud assessment](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/) should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security.\n\nUpgrade your [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), a powerful tool offering comprehensive cloud inventory, advanced risk detection, multi-cloud support, and streamlined compliance processes to strengthen your business's cloud security posture."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","seoTitle":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","description":"Serverless computing is a collection of services provided by cloud vendors.

It allows users to write and execute code in the cloud without setting up the environment and allocating resources such as VMs beforehand. \n\nBenefits of serverless computing are: \n\n* **A pay-as-you-go model**, allowing code to only run when needed, \n* **No server management required**, since your code is running in the cloud, and you don't have to deal with the environment settings, \n* **Granular updates and patches** that allow developers to make changes at function-level and quickly deploy new versions, \n* **High reliability applications**, since the code runs on the cloud. \n\n## Services offered by cloud vendors \n\nTo further understand what serverless computing has to offer, we must look at services on the market and their features.  \n\n### 1. AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate \n\n**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that allows users, through functions, to run event-driven code without server provisioning or management. AWS Lambda can be used for: \n\n* File processing, \n* Stream processing, \n* Web and mobile applications, \n* IoT backends, and others. \n\nThe event-driven flows help reduce costs for users and add flexibility. Lambda functions are triggered by events, and customers only pay for the time the code is running.  \n\nMoreover, when creating a Lambda function, you can either start writing a function from scratch, or use sample code such as Amazon’s blueprints or the AWS Serverless Application Repository to implement your desired code. \n\n**AWS Fargate** is a compute engine that provides a serverless solution for application deployment by removing the need for infrastructure management. \n\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a service that allows Kubernetes instances to run both in the cloud and on-premises. EKS, together with AWS Fargate, produce a serverless solution for containers. \n\nFargate can also be used with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), with no additional changes required for your applications. \n\n### 2. Azure Serverless  \n\nMicrosoft Azure offers a collection of serverless compute solutions. Just like AWS Lambda, Azure Serverless enables its users to deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nSome of the Azure compute services are: \n\n* **Serverless Functions.** Just like AWS Lambda, Azure allows users to write event-driven code in their preferred language. Costs are applied only when the code is being executed, \n* **Serverless Kubernetes.** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), together with AKS virtual nodes, provide a serverless solution that reduces the infrastructure management workload of Kubernetes clusters. \n* **Serverless Containerized Microservices.** With this solution, applications are deployed in containers without managing the infrastructure,  \n* **Serverless Application Environments.** Using Azure App Service, web, mobile, and API applications are hosted in a fully managed environment.  \n\nAzure also provides low-code or no-code application development with Power Apps. This feature allows developers to construct applications using drag-and-drop functionalities, connectors, and readily-available solutions for common use cases. \n\n### 3. Cloud Run and Cloud Functions by Google Cloud \n\nThese two solutions offered by Google Cloud provide serverless compute services.  \n\n**Cloud Run** is an application development tool that separates infrastructure management from the code by placing applications in containers. Using Cloud Run, microservices can be deployed without specific configurations. It is highly scalable, and it can scale to zero – this means that if a service has no requests, all containers are removed, reducing costs. It supports the following programming languages: Go, Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, as well as others. \n\n**Cloud Functions** is a similar service to AWS Lambda and Azure Serverless. \n\n## Possible vulnerabilities of serverless computing \n\n### 1. Lack of source code security \n\nMany cyber attacks are successful due to poor code security.  \n\nAccording to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), one of the most common attacks on web applications in 2022 was SQL Injection. Whether an application is hosted in the cloud or not, user input should always be treated very carefully. \n\nTo correctly handle data received from users, you should sanitize it correctly and use prepared statements. \n\n### 2. Outdated or unpatched libraries, packages, and dependencies \n\nAnother element that affects applications' security is the libraries, packages, technologies, and dependencies used.  \n\nIn 2021, a critical vulnerability was discovered. Log4j, a popular Java framework used for logging messages in applications, introduced a massive flaw: it allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host machine. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as Log4Shell, [affected around 3 billion devices](https://www.acaglobal.com/insights/log4shell-vulnerability-what-we-know-and-action-steps-take).   \n\nServerless functions in the cloud were not immune to this attack. The functions written in Java that were using Log4j were vulnerable to Log4Shell. \n\nWhile not having to deal with underlying infrastructure management is an advantage of serverless computing, technologies used by developers still have to be used safely. \n\nHow do you protect your code from such vulnerabilities? \n\n* Only use trusted libraries, \n* Apply updates and patches as they appear, \n* Continuously assess your code, \n* Remove any unnecessary dependencies. \n\n### 3. Monitor your cloud infrastructure \n\nThis measure is a given. Log and monitor what your applications do to identify any odd behavior.  \n\nDocument every event that interacts with your code and see how your applications respond.  \n\n### 4. Integrate cryptography into your code \n\n[Encrypt sensitive data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) to ensure confidentiality in your applications’ flow. You should encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest data using AES. \n\nMoreover, safely store secrets and keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or in your cloud using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault,  \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\nDo not store keys, connection strings, or passwords in the source code or in plain text. \n\n### 5. Too much information is disclosed in error messages. \n\nWe’ve all encountered verbose error messages. \n\nDevelopers should not disclose information about errors or exceptions to the user. Instead, they should be handled in the code, and the message displayed should offer minimal explanations without revealing why the error occurred. \n\n  \n\nWhile writing code in the cloud and quickly deploying it without infrastructure management is tempting, you should be careful.  \n\nImplement the best practices recommended in this article to address serverless computing vulnerabilities and secure your cloud environment. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"A Word on Cloud Security","seoTitle":"A Word on Cloud Security","description":"Given all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen.

Or about security at all? Let’s zoom out even more and talk about the virtues we, as people, often desire for ourselves and look for in others. These include courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness. As Brian Tracy points out in his excellent book, “No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline”, all these virtues depend on and are guaranteed by one of them: **integrity**. Just like this, our software products have multiple requirements including functional (it must solve specific problems) and non-functional (performance, availability, efficiency, etc.). All these depend on the trust our users have in our systems to keep their data safe; they depend on **security**.\n\nIn theory, the most secure software is the one that doesn’t exist. If you have nothing, there is nothing to worry about. In practice, you will probably want to achieve certain things, to deliver certain features within a reasonable timeframe and budget. Luckily for us, the cloud providers offer a sizeable suite of services that might help us. In the era of data-driven, microservices-based, global-scale systems, we end up using some of them for compute (e.g. EC2, AKS, GKE, Lambda, Cloud Run), storage (S3), business intelligence (Redshift, Power BI), integration (Pub/Sub, Kinesis, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus), and so on. AWS even offers a service that lets you make use of their (satellite) ground stations. If you are competing with Elon’s Starlink or you are building a weather forecasting system, you might find it useful\n\n## Great Power, Great Responsibility\n\nNaturally, you must understand how to configure each cloud service you end up using and make them work together. One fundamental concept provided by the cloud is the way you manage access. You have control over both the network (so the service is actually reachable or not) and IAM (whether the clients must have identities and sufficient permissions). On one end of the spectrum, you can leave everything open and hope everyone expects that you have it properly set up. On the other end, you can choose a very restrictive configuration that might slow down your team. This is often known as the tradeoff between security and usability (for your dev team in this case). Over the past few years, the industry started shifting more toward security introducing concepts such as zero trust security and SSO (please make use of it whenever possible; also, it’s a shame that some companies still provide SSO only with their enterprise plans).\n\nClassically, you had a number of VMs (on-premises, VPS), installed and configured UFW, set up SSH access, and sent the SSH keys to your colleagues. Now, you can configure public and **private** (sub)networks, connect your cloud networks to your on-premises networks, deploy load balancers, define firewall rules without ever SSH-ing into the VMs, and assign identities and permissions to the VMs (and any other compute service). If previously your team didn’t interact too much with the infrastructure side, **now the infrastructure is part of the application**.\n\n## Network Access\n\nStarting with configuring the network access, here you have multiple options to control it. Perhaps the simplest concept is making the resources public or private. Your VM might have a vulnerable OS version, but if nothing can reach it and it cannot reach the internet, the risk is considerably lower. Not only can you run most compute and database services in a private network, but you can also configure fully managed services to be accessible through the provider's internal network (without traversing the internet) by leveraging services such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).\n\nFurthermore, you can (have to) configure firewalls. Here the services vary a bit. Google Cloud calls them [VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls). You define them at the VPC level and can optionally choose to which instances they should apply based on tags (they are not equivalent to AWS/Azure tags. In Google Cloud, the equivalent would be the resource labels) or service accounts (almost every resource can have an identity, which in Google Cloud, is given by service accounts). In AWS, you work with security groups that are assigned to virtual machines. Besides allowing traffic (by default everything is denied) from certain IP addresses or CIDRs, you can also choose based on the security group of the source (please make use of this). You can also achieve this in Azure, but you have to combine two types of resources: network security groups (these are the actual firewalls) and application security groups (you can associate these with the network tags from Google Cloud). In fact, here are the sources you can configure for each provider:\n\n* AWS: CIDRs, IP addresses, security groups, prefix lists (if you want to allow traffic coming only from certain AWS services)\n* Azure: CIDRs, IP addresses, application security groups, service tags (e.g. \\`AzureLoadBalancer\\`, \\`Internet\\`)\n* Google Cloud: CIDRs, IP addresses, network tags (defined on each instance), service accounts\n\nOf course, this is not all. You also have network access control lists (NACLs), firewalls specific to each service (especially managed databases from Azure), NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPNs, virtual appliances, traffic splitting, firewalls that you install on the VMs, and a lot more. All these bring considerable complexity and make it extra difficult to configure the optimal **effective network access**.\n\nAdditionally, while there are tools that check the traffic in real-time, these are often dealing with network paths that you defined and are aware of. There might be paths you did not intend to leave open that an attacker might make us for **lateral movement**.\n\n## IAM Access\n\nNot only can every member of your organization have a user (or multiple) with access to certain parts of your infrastructure, but so does almost every compute resource. Just like you provide John with permission to read data from a bucket, so you assign a role to a VM achieving the same access. The difference is that anything that runs on the VM and everyone who can access it (i.e. SSH into it) now can do everything the VM can do.\n\nFundamentally, this mechanism of assigning roles to resources is excellent. You have clear visibility of the principals (users, resources) that can access a given service, you can grant or revoke access at any moment, and you have a meaningful trail of access logs. The alternative is often based on keys/secrets and is almost impossible to trace properly because anyone that has the key can access the resource (it’s easy to lose track of who has the key) (secret scanners help a bit here but are limited to the resources they run on).\n\nWe just have to understand its implications. If attackers manage to break into a VM and if that VM has high (excessive?) permissions, the attackers will not only be able to access our data, but they will also be able to spin up additional instances (crypto mining?) and delete existing resources (service disruption and data loss).\n\nAgain, here it’s important to understand the effective permissions each resource has. There are multiple factors that contribute to the effective permissions such as the role assigned to the resource, permissions inherited from group memberships or from assignments at a higher level (the VM might be an owner at the subscription level in Azure thus having access to everything in that subscription), and policies configured on the target resources such as [resource policies in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) and [access policies for Azure Key Vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/security-features).\n\nAnother important aspect about effective permissions in the context of data access is encryption, especially encryption with customer-managed keys. For example, if you store data on S3 and encrypt it with a key managed by AWS KMS, you must have access to both the S3 bucket/object and the encryption key from KMS. Managing encryption keys deserves an article on its own.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nEven if you have pristine infrastructure security, you still must provide access to someone (at least two admins so one doesn’t lock himself out by mistake - aka admin redundancy) to maintain the infrastructure and manage access for everyone else. This is an example of a highly privileged user. This in itself is not a major risk. However, if highly privileged users don’t have strong authentication mechanisms in place (MFA, preferably with strong factors), they can become liabilities. We are all subject to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n\nWhen you find out that an attacker managed to gain access to a highly privileged user, after revoking the sessions and rotating the credentials, you will want to find out the impact. For this, you need to know the systems to which the user has access. This can be quite challenging since the permissions are often spread across multiple systems.\n\nFor example, if you have Okta as the identity provider and AWS for the cloud infrastructure, you have to check both systems and link the results in order to determine what a person actually has access to. In Okta you just provide access to an application, but in AWS that application is often an AWS Organization with multiple accounts.\n\n## Ending Notes\n\nGiven all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen. However, we can go fast and build secure systems. It’s not a zero-sum game. You probably have people in your organization that are naturally passionate about security. Give them the responsibility, the training, and the tools. You probably don’t need that many people to do security full-time since the tools are getting increasingly powerful.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Cloud Data Security For AWS: An In-Depth Guide","seoTitle":"Cloud Data Security For AWS: An In-Depth Guide ","description":"Understanding and managing all your assets and services in the cloud are demanding tasks.

It is easy to overlook even the smallest configuration and introduce a vulnerability in your cloud infrastructure. \n\nIn this article, you will find a comprehensive guide that will help you understand possible misconfigurations in your AWS cloud infrastructure and how to remediate them.  \n\n## Steps to secure your cloud environment \n\n### 1. Data classification \n\n[Classifying your cloud data](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) can help you easily sort, retrieve, and prioritize it. This is done using a tag (sometimes called a label), which is applied to cloud storage assets. In this way, that data is placed into one or more categories and can be identified more easily. \n\nBenefits of data classification include: \n\n* Risk management, \n* Compliance,  \n* Security. \n\nIn AWS, tags are key-value pairs that add metadata to your data. \n\nThe AWS documentation recommends using a three-tiered approach, with the following tags: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official,  \n* Secret. \n\nHowever, users can tailor data classification to their needs and use their own tags. In addition, **tag policies** can be used to standardize their creation and ensure consistency across all assets. \n\nTo accomplish classification using tags in your AWS environment, you have the following options: \n\n* Using the Amazon console, at resource level, where tags can be added either at creation or after, \n* Programmatically, using the Amazon API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. \n\nAccording to the AWS documentation, restrictions regarding tags include: \n\n* There cannot be more than 50 tags per resource, \n* Each tag key must be unique for each resource, \n* The maximum key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8, \n* The maximum value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. \n\n### 2. Encryption \n\nEncryption is the process of altering data in order to hide its content and ensure confidentiality because entities that do not have the decryption key cannot decrypt the data and, therefore, cannot read its content. \n\nThe two types of encryption mechanisms are: \n\n* **Symmetric encryption**, where the encryption and the decryption key are the same, and \n* **Asymmetric encryption**, where the two keys are different; one is called public key and the other private key. \n\nEncryption can be done in all three states of data: \n\n* [At rest,](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) \n* In transit, \n* In use. \n\nIn this article, we will discuss data encryption in the first two states, but [a more detailed article](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) regarding encryption also describes encryption in the last state of data. \n\nFor data in transit, AWS provides the following solution: \n\n1. Encrypt the data using SSL/TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are transport layer protocols that protect the data in transit. TLS is a newer and improved version of SSL. \n2. Perform client-side encryption. This solution requires the user to encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud, but it is more difficult since the client has to deal with the encryption process, key management, and other services. \n\nFor data at rest, AWS provides encryption for the following services:  \n\n* Amazon EBS,  \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift,  \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nAWS uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) encryption algorithm, an industry-recommended standard and one of the strongest algorithms for symmetric encryption. \n\nKey management is also a very important element of data encryption. If your keys are not stored safely, then no matter how strong the encryption algorithm is, a malicious party may be able to read your data. \n\nA few best practices regarding encryption keys are: \n\n* Do not store your keys in the same place as your data or in the source code, \n* Rotate and retire keys regularly to minimize the impact of a breach, \n* Manage key deletion, \n* Use Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs) to generate your keys. \n\nAWS KMS (AWS Key Management System) is a comprehensive solution that helps users deal with all the trouble that comes with cryptographic keys. \n\nAWS KMS helps you: \n\n* Create cryptographic keys, \n* Define policies and control how the keys are used, \n* Audit the keys usage to ensure they are used legitimately. \n\nAccording to AWS, this service can be used: \n\n1. Through the AWS Management Console, \n2. Using the AWS KMS APIs. \n\n### 3. Access control \n\nRegulating access control is an essential step to your [cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) program.  \n\nTo manage access control in AWS, you can use policies, which can be assigned at the following levels: \n\n* Users, \n* Groups of users, \n* Roles, \n* Resources. \n\nPolicies define permissions. To correctly implement them, use the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) to only allow access rights to the necessary users for the minimum amount of time possible.  \n\nLet’s look at an example where a policy is applied to a resource.  \n\nAn AWS S3 bucket is a type of asset used to store object-like data such as files, databases, and other unstructured data. \n\nA bucket policy contains rules based on which access is allowed or denied and is written in JSON.  \n\n```jsonld\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Id\": \"S3PolicyId1\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": \"*\",\n            \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\",\n                \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*\"\n            ],\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"NotIpAddress\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*Policy source – docs.aws.amazon.com* \n\nAnalyzing the image above, we understand that the policy is applied to a bucket resource, the rule for the permission is “Deny”, and the result of the bucket policy is denying access to the objects stored in the specified bucket unless the requests are made with source IPs in the subnet 54.240.143.0/24. \n\n### 4. Data loss prevention \n\nData loss prevention (DLP) is a protection mechanism for sensitive data that ensures that no unintentional or malicious disclosures occur. DLP prevents data breaches by ensuring no confidential data is accidentally leaked, lost, or stolen. \n\n**Amazon Macie** is a data security and privacy service that protects users’ sensitive data using machine learning technologies and pattern matching. \n\nThis tool identifies sensitive data using **sensitive data discovery jobs**, which analyze S3 buckets. Sensitive data discovery jobs use pre-defined or user-defined lists (or a combination of both) to single out confidential data by matching patterns to the lists. \n\nA passport number is an example of sensitive data that Amazon Macie could match. This is because it has a set number of digits, some corresponding to the owner's region or country. \n\nAfter identifying sensitive data, Amazon Macie can: \n\n* use IAM policies to filter traffic to it,  \n* encrypt and decrypt data,  \n* perform logging and monitoring through AWS CloudTrail integration, and others.  \n\n### 5. Availability \n\nAvailability means that users should be able to access their data without disruptions at any point. \n\nA solution for availability in the cloud is **availability zones**. \n\nAn availability zone is a geographical area where groups of data centers are located. These data centers contain replicated data and provide redundancy regarding electrical power, networking, and connectivity. \n\nAn AWS region contains multiple AWS availability zones, all within 100km of each other, which are independent and provide redundancy. \n\nSome AWS regions around the globe are: \n\n* North America,  \n* South America, \n* Europe,  \n* China,  \n* South Africa, and others. \n\nThese regions provide high availability. \n\nAnother solution for availability is DDoS Protection. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are attempts to bring down a service or a resource by sending a large amount of traffic to them using controlled machines. \n\nAWS Shield is the AWS DDoS Protection service that protects applications hosted in the cloud. \n\nAWS Shield has two tiers: \n\n* Standard, \n* Advanced. \n\nBesides the features that come with the Standard plan, which are at network and transport layer, the Advanced tier of AWS Shield provides: \n\n* integration with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* real-time visibility into attacks,  \n* additional detection and mitigation of sophisticated DDOS attacks, and others. \n\n## Secure your cloud environment \n\nAfter understanding the security demands required for the cloud, implementing them seems like a daunting task. However, using Cyscale, you can easily check if you’re lacking any of the mentioned implementations and remediate any findings. \n\nCyscale has over 400 controls that cover a large variety of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and offer support not only for AWS, but for Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud as well. \n\n\n\nEnhance your AWS cloud data security with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/) to automate the contextual analysis of misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, access, and data for an accurate risk assessment.

This guide provides insights into best practices that are integral to this strategy.\n\nData security is one of the biggest concerns of cloud-based organizations. When you think about protecting data, you need to make sure you’re providing the following features:\n\n* Confidentiality,\n* Integrity,\n* Availability.\n\nMoreover, these three security principles need to be implemented for all three states of data, which are:\n\n* In motion,\n* In use,\n* At rest.\n\nThis mission may seem daunting. Let’s break it down and understand every step of the process of securing data. In this article, you will find out:\n\n* The type of attacks that threaten your data,\n* Cloud security best practices,\n* Security solutions on the market from cloud service providers,\n* How to identify any gaps in your security policies.\n\n## **How do you ensure confidentiality?**\n\nConfidentiality is a security principle that states that only authorized users should be able to access the data. It should not be visible to unauthorized entities.\n\n### **Encryption**\n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is the process of scrambling data to obtain unreadable ciphertext. The algorithm uses a key to encrypt it, and if you are not in possession of the decryption key, you cannot reverse it back to its original state.\n\nEncryption solutions for the three states of data are: \n\n* For in motion data: SSL/TLS. They are transport protocols that encrypt data in transit. \n* For in use data: memory encryption, called Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). It requires specialized hardware, and it encrypts RAM memory. \n* [For at rest data:](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) industry-recommended symmetric algorithms such as AES-256 are used to perform full disk, database, file system, and cloud assets encryption and to safely store data. \n\nUsing these best practices, you can improve your cloud security posture and prevent data breaches or other security incidents.\n\n### **Access control** \n\nA layered approach should be used when securing data in the cloud. This is where a robust **[cloud infrastructure security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/)** becomes crucial. This means that encryption of data at rest should only be considered as the last measure of protection if access control rules are bypassed. \n\nYou must secure access to databases, buckets, and other storage assets by restricting it as much as possible. In doing this, you become compliant with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\nA few access control best practices for [database protection](https://cyscale.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-databases/) are:\n\n* Filter inbound and outbound traffic,\n* Secure your database connection,\n* Keep your connection details secret.\n\nFor [buckets that contain sensitive information](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/#storage-access), do not allow public read/write access and use access control lists to define granular rules.\n\nBesides access control, to ensure robust data protection, strong authentication mechanisms should be put in place. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a must-have security measure for cloud computing environments.\n\nBy implementing these IAM (Identity and Access Management) best practices, attack surface is reduced and your cloud infrastructure is secured.\n\n### **Data classification**\n\nClassifying data does not protect it on its own. However, this process can help you understand which is the most sensitive data in order to better focus your efforts to secure it.\n\nAWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure, and Google Cloud provide labels or tags for users to implement [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/). Labels/tags can be predefined by the public cloud vendor or can be user-defined according to the user’s specific needs.\n\n## **How do you ensure integrity?**\n\nEnsuring integrity means that data must not be altered in transit or at rest. Integrity is usually accomplished using hashes and checksums.\n\nThey are computed before the data is used or transferred and then again after. If the two values of hashes/checksums match, then the data was not altered in transit or at rest. Otherwise, that data was tampered with.\n\nLet’s look at public cloud vendors and how they provide data integrity services:\n\n* AWS S3 uses CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256 to check the data integrity after uploading/downloading,\n* Google Cloud also uses CRC32C checksums to verify data integrity.\n\n## **How do you ensure availability?**\n\nData availability means that any user should be able at any point to access their data without disruptions.\n\nFor data in the public cloud, vendors provide solutions to replicate and backup it in different data centers and regions.\n\nWe need to look at **availability zones** to understand availability in the cloud.\n\nAvailability zones are groups of data centers in the same region containing replicated data. If a data center fails, the other data center in the availability zone takes the responsibility, providing fault tolerance and increased availability and preventing data loss.\n\nMoreover, public cloud vendors support region pairs. A region is paired with another region at a great distance (for example, at least 300km away for Azure). If a natural disaster, civil unrest, or any other unforeseen events occur, the secondary region becomes the main source of cloud service.\n\nAnother service available in the public cloud that helps ensure availability is **DDOS protection**.\n\nDDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an attack designed to crash an application or a service by sending substantial amounts of traffic to it.\n\nA few examples of available DDOS services to secure cloud infrastructure are:\n\n* AWS Shield,\n* Azure DDOS Protection,\n* Google Cloud Armor.\n\n**Implementing our recommendations**\n\nEnsuring [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) is not an easy task. There are many aspects to be considered, and a small mistake can leave a vulnerability in your cloud environment.\n\nCyscale provides powerful dashboards to ensure visibility of your assets, the identities in your cloud, and an overview of your data security.\n\nMoreover, 400+ security controls ensure that your security teams have implemented the cybersecurity principles and best practices. Here are some examples of controls that can be used to ensure data security:\n\n* **In motion data encryption**: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption* for Microsoft Azure\n* **At rest data encryption**: *Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer*-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) for Google Cloud\n* **Access control**: *Ensure S3 bucket policy does not grant Allow permission to everyone* for AWS\n* **Data classification**: *Ensure Kubernetes Clusters are configured with Labels* for Google Cloud\n* **DDOS Protection**: *Ensure Anti-DDoS access and security log service is enabled* for Alibaba Cloud\n\nBefore diving into specific controls, it's essential to acknowledge the evolving **[cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/)** that businesses face. With a constantly changing digital landscape, understanding these challenges can help shape your security strategies more effectively."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","seoTitle":"Best Practices for Securing Databases in the Cloud ","description":"A database is one of the most important cloud assets.

They can: \n\n* manage their own database in the cloud, or \n* use a service provided by their cloud vendor. \n\nThe latter is usually the easier choice since the cloud vendor takes care of security features.  \n\nHowever, your database may be vulnerable in both cases if you don’t configure your environment correctly. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for securing databases in the cloud and how to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that may exist or appear in the future. \n\n## Best practices \n\n### 1. Filter inbound and outbound traffic. \n\nManaging traffic to and from the database is the first layer of database protection. Place databases behind firewalls and restrict the traffic allowed to reach them as much as possible. \n\nYou can implement more granular rules by only allowing a list of known IPs to connect to a database (for example, the range of addresses specific to a known data center), or by filtering traffic based on other criteria. \n\nMoreover, you can apply conditional access for users when administering the database. You can ask for additional security checks like Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure the entities managing the database are legitimate. \n\n### 2. Ensure availability through redundancy \n\nWhen deploying a database in the public cloud, you have the option to ensure availability through redundancy. You can replicate a database in different data centers and even different geographical regions. \n\nIf one data center or region fails, you can rely on a replication of the database located in a different data center to work. \n\n### 3. Encrypt your database \n\nDatabase [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) is important for protecting your data at rest.  \n\nEnsure that only authorized entities can see the data you’re storing in the database by [encrypting it ](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/)with a strong, recommended algorithm such as AES-256. Keep your encryption keys safe by storing them separately from the data, use strong generation algorithms and rotate them every 90 days or less. \n\n### 4. Secure your database connection \n\nNot only data at rest is vulnerable. When you're transferring data to and from the database, it is essential to encrypt your traffic.  \n\nThis is called encryption for data in transit and is implemented with the TLS/SSL protocols. \n\n### 5. Keep your connection details secret \n\nDo not disclose database connection strings, keys, certificates, and other secrets that may be used to breach your database. You can use cloud solutions to keep your cryptographic secrets safe: \n\n* [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) Key Vault, \n* [AWS ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/)Key Management Service (AWS KMS), \n* [Google Cloud ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/)Secret Manager, \n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), and others. \n\n### 6. Log connection attempts \n\nKeep track of who is trying to connect to your database by logging any authentication attempts. In this way, you can see if: \n\n* someone unauthorized is trying to or is connecting to the database, \n* there is a brute-force attack taking place.  \n\n### 7. Perform regular database backups \n\nDatabases should be backed up regularly, to prevent loss of data, in the case of: \n\n* Data corruption, and \n* Ransomware attacks. \n\nAlthough ransomware attacks are less common in cloud environments at the moment, attackers could in time develop the proper tactics. \n\n![RPO and RTO](/img/20_blog-rpo-and-rto.webp#shadow \"RPO and RTO\")\n\nThe time between the backups is known as RPO (Recovery Point Objective). It is measured as the time that passed between the last backup and the current one. If a disaster appears, the data written in that time is lost. \n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the time it takes for an application to go back online after a disaster and to restore its data.   \n\nRTO and RPO should be kept in acceptable limits. \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to ensure you’re implementing all the best practices we mentioned in this article. [Cyscale ](https://cyscale.com/)has over 400 controls that can help you secure your entire cloud environment. \n\nHere are some examples of controls that check for any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities regarding your database setup in the public cloud: \n\n* *Ensure encrypted storage is used for VMs that might host a database* for AWS \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances require all incoming connections to use SSL* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database* for Alibaba Cloud \n\nAlong with these controls that alert you on any findings, you receive remediation steps to quickly eliminate any vulnerabilities and secure your database in the cloud. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":9,"numPages":3,"currentPage":2,"category":"Cloud Security","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Expert Insights and Tips | Cyscale Blog","seoDescription":"Explore expert insights and practical tips on Cloud Security.
