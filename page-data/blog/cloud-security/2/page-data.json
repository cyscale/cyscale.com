Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in Google Cloud, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow Google Cloud customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your Google Cloud environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

PII can be used with or without other data to identify an individual. \n\nExamples of Personally Identifiable Information are: \n\n* name, \n* social security number, \n* biometric records, \n* unique personal document numbers such as passport or driver’s license number, \n* medical, educational, financial history, and many others. \n\nPII information can be categorized into two parts: \n\n1. Linked information. This type of data can on its own single out an individual. \n2. Unlinked information. A person cannot be directly traced based on it, but if combined with another piece of information it could identify an individual. Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":9,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2,"category":"Cloud Security","seoTitle":"Cyscale - Cloud Security","seoDescription":"News about Cyscale Cloud Security","categoriesList":["Cloud Security","Compliance","News","Product","CSPM","CNAPP","Misconfigurations","IAM"]}},"staticQueryHashes":["220583031","4109069157","632500807","981947644"],"slicesMap":{}}
