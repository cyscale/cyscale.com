Romania, for example, has earned its title as the ‘Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe’ thanks to the strength of the tech community in Cluj-Napoca, the second largest city in the country.  \n\n## **Public cloud as an enabler and a challenge** \n\nThe public cloud is the key enabler for all these businesses. But while cloud services from AWS, Azure, Google, Alibaba and others are more widely adopted and more secure than ever before, the cloud is an increasingly complex technology to manage, with a multitude of proprietary settings and controls, growing ever more granular. As a result, the greatest challenge to cloud as an enabler exists not in the security of the cloud itself, but in the policies, controls, and workflows for security of the technology.  \n\n## **Cloud security breaches are caused by mistakes and misconfigurations**  \n\nIn nearly all cases of cloud data breach, it is the user, not the cloud provider, who fails to effectively manage the controls used to protect an organization’s data. In fact, Gartner estimates 99% of cloud security failures are the customer’s fault and there is a wealth of additional research to back this up. \n\nThe simple fact is that humans can no longer correlate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations manually because of the sheer volume of alerts and complexity of configurations. The problem of SaaS security is especially pervasive in companies with small security teams, where it’s also especially hard for a CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure to prioritize remediation.   \n\nNot even large, well-resourced companies are exempt, with Microsoft, Twitter, and T-Mobile among the headlines in 2023 for security incidents leading to significant breaches of cloud data.   \n\n## **What makes an effective cloud security strategy?** \n\nIf you’re a SaaS CTO, CISO, or head of cloud infrastructure responsible for apps and data at a cloud-native or cloud-first business you need to deploy an effective cloud security strategy from the get-go. We’ve put together this SaaS CTO security checklist to help you understand what you need to do to get cloud security measures right from the start.\n\n## **The SaaS CTO security checklist**\n\nIn this article we look at the *[five key pillars that make up a strong cloud security strategy,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/)* including how to understand your unique cloud environment based on your specific usage of AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or whichever provider you choose.  \n\nYou also need to consider that your cloud environment may not be static, with developers adding and removing assets, and sensitive data being created on a frequent basis. So, this means your cloud security approach can’t be static either, and you will need some kind of continuous monitoring and assessment program to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities along with a regular review of security policies.  \n\nIn this *[guide to cloud security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/)* we go into actionable detail that will help you create a roadmap for deployment of your cloud security strategy, covering data security when data is in motion, in use, and at rest, the types of attacks that threaten your data and what you can do to defend against them.  \n\n## **Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure** \n\nA foundational building block for any cloud-native cybersecurity strategy is a thorough understanding of your infrastructure and unique characteristics of your web applications including microservices architectures, virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing, among others. \n\nThis guide looks at how you can *[properly assess your cloud-native infrastructure,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-infrastructure/)* draw conclusions and create an efficient plan for remediation.  \n\nIf you need a *[deeper dive into the cloud-native technology stack,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/)* our explainer looks at the differences between cloud-native, cloud-based, and cloud-enabled approaches.  \n\n## **Understanding CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)** \n\nAs adoption of the cloud has grown, so too has the need for specialized tools to secure it. At some point you will have come across the term Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) as an essential part of a cloud security program designed to identify and expose the unintentional risks that can expose your data, or make your code or your infrastructure vulnerable to hackers. \n\n## **What is CSPM?** \n\nCSPM solutions use the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google, to gather rich data on your specific cloud configuration and workloads. These cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\nUnintentional cloud configuration mistakes typically occur because of the complexity of the environment or because of poor visibility into the organization’s cloud security posture due to too many dashboards, management panels, or controls. This becomes your problem.  \n\nRegardless of the reason, it is important to understand that even one misconfiguration can lead to a disastrous data breach or leakage. \n\nWe have an *[essential guide to understanding Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/understanding-cspm-an-essential-guide/)* for those that need familiarize themselves.   \n\n## **Best practices for CSPM** \n\nIn our *[CSPM best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/5-cspm-best-practices-and-strategies/)* document, we look at how CSPM solutions can be used to ensure visibility of assets; use context to identify and prioritize assets with the greatest risk; ensure compliance with relevant frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST and more); maintain ongoing monitoring of your environment to identify new threats; and finally, direct you to efficient remediation.    \n\n## **What to look for in a CSPM solution** \n\nOur separate guide on *[what to look for in a CSPM solution](https://cyscale.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-a-cspm/)* equips you with key questions to ask and considerations to help you make the right choice for your business at your current state of cloud maturity.  \n\nWhile our *[buyer’s guide to cloud security solutions](https://cyscale.com/blog/buyers-guide-cloud-security-solutions/)* goes into even further detail regarding the difference between enterprise-grade solutions, security offerings from your cloud service provider, and the free tools on offer.  \n\n## **Understanding CNAPP** \n\nAnother acronym you may encounter - CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) - refers to a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps and combines multiple functionalities from separate toolsets, including CSPM, CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), and CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), essentially covering all the bases of identity and access, code, and infrastructure.  \n\nWe have a primer on *[cloud-native applications security](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/)* that looks at why and when you may need a CNAPP solution.\n\nB﻿ook a free assessment with Cyscale to use CNAPP capabilities to secure your cloud security posture.\n\n<a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/></a>\n\n<div class=\"pb-0 pt-4 lg:pb-0 lg:pt-2 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"https://cyscale.com/cloud-security-risk-assessment/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">Start assessment</button></a></div>\n\n## **Common cloud misconfigurations and how to avoid them** \n\nIn terms of actionable insights, our extensive handbook on *[common cloud misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/common-cloud-misconfigurations-how-to-avoid-them/)* looks at five of the most common cloud misconfigurations SaaS companies encounter, including: storage access configuration, access control, unrestricted network ports for inbound and outbound traffic, encryption oversights, or disabled or misconfigured logging and monitoring. \n\nWorking through this checklist can help you establish best practices for securing your apps and data in the cloud, including the use of tags to help establish security policies across all your relevant assets.  \n\n## **The dangers of alert fatigue** \n\nBy the time you have designed a cloud security strategy and possibly deployed a few tools to help you enforce it, you will begin generating security alerts.  \n\nFalse positive alerts are the bane of any CTO or CISO and with cloud environments becoming so complex, alert fatigue is a very real and growing problem. A constant flood of alerts, false positives, and non-contextual information can be overwhelming, because when everything is important, nothing is important.  \n\n*[Alert fatigue](https://cyscale.com/blog/alert-fatigue-cybersecurity-cloud-security/)* is one of the biggest complaints cybersecurity professionals have about the tools they use. As a Cloud Security Manager we spoke to says: \"When you see so many alerts, you freak out for a second.\"  \n\nSo when it comes to beating alert fatigue, the onus is on the tools you use, and we believe three innovations are essential: \n\nCustom risk rules – Define your own threshold for security posture. What works for one company won’t work for another. \n\nAutomation – With so many assets across so many cloud providers to track, humans cannot keep up. Continuous and automated detection of misconfigurations is critical. \n\nContext - Not all alerts are created equal, and different teams have different responsibilities. Context allows you to immediately prioritize tasks. \n\nWhich brings us to... \n\n## **Incident response planning** \n\nThis is a critical part of any effective cloud security plan, because while an effective security strategy focuses on preventative maintenance, an incident response plan sets out the steps you take when a security breach happens.  \n\n## **Designing an effective incident response plan** \n\nWe have a *[step-by-step checklist in our essential cloud security tips](https://cyscale.com/blog/essential-tips-cloud-security/)* you can use to establish your incident response plan, looking at: \n\n* Determining what caused the incident \n* Containing the incident \n* Notifying affected parties such as customers if customer data is affected\n* Conducting a root cause analysis \n* Implementing remediation measures \n* Learnings and evaluation \n\nAs the threat landscape constantly evolves, so must your cloud security awareness and strategy. Business leaders must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities as well as any changes in their existing environment.  \n\nEven with a good cloud security strategy in place, an effective plan is an adaptive plan, and one that ensures ongoing defense against new threats.\n\nB﻿ook a demo now to find out actionable insights and prepare for cloud security challenges.\n\n<div class=\"pb-12 pt-6 lg:pb-12 lg:pt-6 flex flex-col items-center\"><a href=\"/request-demo/\"><button class=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F26AA] to-[#FF4A56] hover:from-[#FF4A56] hover:to-[#0F26AA] block font-medium rounded text-white uppercase text-center no-underline hover:no-underline max-w-sm lg:inline-block font-hind\" style=\"padding: 0.625rem 2.5rem;\">BOOK A DEMO</button></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups    ","seoTitle":"The Buyer’s Guide to Cloud Security Solutions for Startups | Cyscale ","description":"This essential guide for startups looks at the pros and cons of enterprise-grade, free, and cloud providers' own security solutions.

From your intellectual property and software services you sell, to sensitive data on customers and users, any threat can put your reputation on the line.  \n\nWhile public cloud resources are key enablers of business, they come with the adoption of a shared responsibility model that makes it difficult to define your security perimeter. This makes securing your apps and data in the cloud a complex and confusing process. But it doesn’t have to be. Good cloud security is achievable for any business, regardless of size, and it shouldn’t take all your time and resources to get it right.  \n\n### Context is king \n\nHow many cloud resources or assets am I running? What even is a cloud resource? My engineers are creating new assets every week, how am I going to keep track of them all? Where does the responsibility of AWS end and mine begin? These are the kind of questions you are going to be faced with, whether cloud security is your full-time job or just part of your responsibility for the overall tech stack.  \n\nFinding answers to these questions and more, will take time and effort because there are no standard responses. Everyone’s cloud infrastructure is different and brings with it unique risks.  \n\nThis is why context is so important. Cybersecurity tools are notorious for creating alert fatigue – an overwhelming number of alerts for every vulnerability, misconfiguration, and new threat out there. Following up on all these alerts as and when they come in, can easily start out as a fool’s errand and frequently become humanly impossible.  \n\nFor example: An unsecured Virtual Machine in isolation may pose no risk but will still trigger an alert. An unsecured VM that has access to a bucket used to store sensitive client data poses a much bigger risk that your company, your customers, and your lawyers will care about.  \n\n**Identify** \n\nBeing able to identify the risks is only one part of the challenge.   \n\n**Prioritize** \n\nUnderstanding the context of the risk to prioritize it is an essential second stage in the process. \n\n**Fix** \n\nThe steps needed to remediate the risk are the third stage in the solution. \n\nBecause there is no one-size-fits-all solution to cloud infrastructure security, any attempt to follow this path will eventually result in frustration due to not feeling in control, and a lack of understanding of the impact of a security issue, which can lead to bigger threats.  \n\n### My cloud provider has its own security tools, can’t I just use them? \n\nAll the big cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offer a suite of security tools specific to their products and these are a common choice for cloud native organizations as they can be added on when buying cloud services and are built by the same provider.  \n\nBut these solutions have evolved in line with the sprawling menu of cloud services on offer, and the application of these tools has become granular to the level where some security components and their corresponding configuration are attached to specific products and services, and then again to specific regions and resources.  \n\nThe cloud providers charge for security services in much the same way they do for cloud resources. Not only does this frequently trigger the ‘bill shock’ associated with cloud consumption, because activating a native security solution for a service introduces unpredictability into the pricing, it makes management of your cloud security posture very complex and time consuming.  \n\nThis approach has significant implications for context as well – because information is scattered within the toolset, you are required to make the relevant correlations yourself, resulting in poor overall visibility and blind spots.  \n\nFurthermore, this is just for a single cloud environment. If your organization needs to secure apps or data across multiple clouds, you need to learn a whole other set of security services and tools specific to the cloud environment.  \n\nSo, if you use the AWS supplied toolset, you must go to 1,000 different places to understand all your security settings, let alone how all the security settings relate and connect to one another. And when you go to Azure, it's another 1,000 places that you go to check. \n\nOf course, some companies will become proficient in using the cloud provider’s own security tools, but there is still the associated cost in deployment and the investment into a non-transferrable skill. This can result in cloud security know-how being concentrated within certain people and makes it difficult to understand your broader posture from both a cloud security and compliance perspective.  \n\n### What about the big-name cloud security solutions I read about in a Gartner report? \n\nThere are well-established vendors, like Check Point, that have developed their portfolios over time, and there are relative newcomers to cloud security, like Orca and Wiz, that have picked up big name customers and you would be wise to assess these offerings.  \n\nHowever, most of these solutions are targeted at enterprise customers with big teams and big budgets, and even the analysts note that some of the most comprehensive security solutions are not suitable for smaller organizations due to the investment required in skills, deployment, and management, not to mention the overall cost.  \n\nFor even the most experienced of users, heavyweight solutions can become overwhelming, resulting in a counter-effective approach as users lose control of their security posture.  \n\n### But there are free tools I can use \n\nThe cloud security landscape is very competitive and there are a range of tools available that claim to be completely free. But anyone making security tools for cloud infrastructure knows that cybersecurity is not something you can cut costs on, so these tools will not remain free, except perhaps for the smallest organizations.  \n\nMost of the free tools are limited in scope or capability requiring a paid ‘upgrade’ to unlock. Others are designed to be self-installed at the free level – a challenge in itself – while the as-a-service version comes with a price tag.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for, and solutions that have no investment in their development are unlikely to offer the level of service and support you get from a paid solution. These tools will quickly become frustrating due to a shortfall in features and an overreliance on multiple offerings to achieve an inferior result.  \n\nCyscale itself offers a free trial of the full product with no limitations, as well as onboarding support to ensure you will get the most value out of our solution before you buy.  \n\n### How do I address cloud infrastructure compliance? \n\nEnabled by the agility of cloud computing, many companies launch SaaS products into the market without fully understanding the regulatory climate, then realize they need to show compliance.   \n\nWith an infrastructure that changes on a weekly or even daily basis as engineers spin up new VMs and resources, preparing for an audit can be stressful, especially in regulated environments where you have to check your security posture against frameworks such as CIS Cloud Benchmarks, ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), HIPAA, PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), NIST, or many others. \n\nFurther challenges can arise in organizations where engineers have adopted a cloud provider’s own security tools, as these products are notoriously difficult to get visibility into whether established policies are being followed in implementations, leaving you blind to security drifts.   \n\nAt the end of the day, compliance should be delivered as a byproduct of good security, and your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) approach should ensure you are able to see compliance with regulatory frameworks and policies without the need to manually correlate reports from multiple applications.  \n\n### Identity, Access, and Entitlements \n\nOne of the biggest challenges when building applications in the cloud is identity, access, and entitlements, sometimes referred to as Identity and Access Management (IAM). This refers to all the best practices and rules that must be followed when establishing authentication and authorization for a user to an organization’s systems and applications, because while keeping track of who has access to what sounds simple, it’s something that is really difficult to do in the cloud. \n\nMoreover, access is not restricted to human users; applications and other types of identities also require access to different types of resources.  \n\nOf course, the big cloud providers each have their own unique approach to access management, and this means learning approaches specific to each cloud environment. Some cloud security solutions integrate with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and other vendors to check for vulnerabilities and help you manage identities and access form a central location, improving your organization’s cloud security posture.  \n\n### Understanding the cloud infrastructure security landscape \n\n**Glossary** \n\n[CSPM](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management) \n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions are designed specifically for cloud environments, using the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by public cloud providers to gather rich data on cloud configuration and workloads. Cloud security platforms use their own sophisticated technologies to process and analyze this data to identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and risks, with some adding additional context and identifying potential threats, as well as suggesting remedial measures before any actual breach occurs. \n\n[Misconfiguration](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) \n\nAn incorrect configuration of a cloud system that may lead to vulnerabilities. Possible misconfigurations are too many to list but may include making sensitive databases publicly accessible, creating identities with access rights more elevated than required, enabling write access on a resource that should be read only.  \n\n[Vulnerability](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) \n\nA vulnerability is an inherent weakness in a cloud system that means a resource is unable to resist the actions of a threat agent. A vulnerability could be created through a misconfiguration, or series of misconfigurations, but it could also be a newly discovered flaw in a piece of code or software that a resource is dependent on.  \n\nThreat \n\nA cloud threat is a type of attack or adversary looking to exploit vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, resulting in data breaches, data loss, system hijacking, and a myriad of other internal and external threats.  \n\nResource \n\nA cloud resource, also known as an asset, refers to any one of a number of entities including but not limited to, a virtual machine, a database, or storage bucket. An asset could also refer to VPC, subnet, policy, security key, or IP address. \n\n[CNAPP](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) \n\nA CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native apps. A cloud-native application is an application that is designed for, run and hosted in the cloud.  \n\nCIEM \n\nCIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) tools manage identities and access privileges to cloud infrastructure and services. It is often deployed as an umbrella solution that includes Identity and Access Management (IAM). \n\n**Download this guide as a PDF** \n\n<div class=\"hs-cta-embed hs-cta-simple-placeholder hs-cta-embed-136438852760\" style=\"max-width:100%; max-height:100%;width:210px;height:42.390625px\" data-hubspot-wrapper-cta-id=\"136438852760\"><a href=\"https://cta-service-cms2.hubspot.com/web-interactives/public/v1/track/redirect?encryptedPayload=AVxigLKTGbp%2Fo9uY%2B1cpwqxYO%2BVdgBMG2bgcgDZpv3UP7fDM0cPci8FmFfQrFEsURZY%2FBCwYOLNlG1XYE6BnbA1HIeTHNfwLiP2GUGYlTRO8CW82qb9egx0YmY9aQqHwOJa6iekClG%2FMfqEbCu0Dp5wkLzxfl7v4ITdglHTHc9cfvbVS11AWnEbx0NEGVzaWJngIJAT7AL7Hb9Sj8j%2BtDc7O96NDo4C5OsZhIeDO7CXDRRccKrDRsTFtfE9f4VAPVJWvV65oHjHpAVfzD5qX8u%2BU%2FIVvOMducO6AS96ZUM4%3D&webInteractiveContentId=136438852760&portalId=5413427\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><img alt=\"Download\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5413427/interactive-136438852760.png\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: fill\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"/></a></div>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","seoTitle":"IPv4 Billing Changes in AWS: Impact on Cloud Costs & Security","description":"Explore how AWS's new IPv4 billing changes, effective from February 2024, will influence both your financial and security strategies.

AWS's involvement is particularly significant given its substantial market presence, and it will likely influence various organizations across different scales and industries.\n\nIn terms of your business and the tech landscape, this change goes beyond additional costs, with the new model affecting network planning, igniting considerations about transitioning to IPv6, and opening opportunities to reassess cloud security strategies.\n\n## The Financial Implications of AWS's New Charging Model for IPv4 Addresses\n\n### Detailed Explanation of Pricing\n\n<br class=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"/img/aws-ip-cost.png\" alt=\"AWS IP Costs after February 1 2024\" title=\"\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nStarting February 1, 2024, AWS will charge for all public IPv4 addresses at a rate of 0.5 cents per hour. While this figure may initially seem inconsequential, it is vital to understand how swiftly it can accumulate. \n\nFor small businesses or individual projects, the impact might be marginal. Our example considers a small organization with 10 public IP addresses:\n\n*10 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $36.5 per month, or $438 per year.*\n\nContrast this with an enterprise operating with 11,000 public IPs: \n\n*11,000 IPs x 0.5 cents per hour x 730 hours in a month = $40,150 per month, or nearly **$500,000 per year**.*\n\n1﻿1,000 IP addresses might sound like an overestimation, but we are seeing organizations with tens of thousands of EC2 instances. Assuming 20-30% of these need public IPs is not out of reach.\n\nThis striking difference highlights the importance of understanding and planning for the financial consequences, particularly for organizations heavily reliant on public IPv4 addresses.\n\n### Budget Considerations for Organizations\n\nAWS's decision to charge for public IPv4 addresses extends beyond a simple financial concern; it prompts businesses to reevaluate their entire approach to IP address utilization. Key considerations include:\n\n* **Reviewing existing usage:** Analyzing current usage patterns is essential for predicting additional costs and identifying opportunities for optimization.\n* **Considering IPv6 migration:** Some may find transitioning to IPv6 a cost-effective alternative, though it must be balanced against compatibility and technical constraints.\n* **Utilizing tools and insights:** Automated security platforms like Cyscale can offer comprehensive insights into your inventory of public IP addresses, helping you understand the big picture and delivering insight that can aid in cost control.\n\nThis policy change serves as a catalyst for reimagining how organizations approach cloud infrastructure financially. The ripple effects will be felt differently across the spectrum, but the core message is clear: understanding, planning, and adapting will be pivotal in navigating this change without unforeseen financial setbacks.\n\nWhether you are a decision-maker concerned about the bottom line or a cloud professional tasked with optimization, these changes necessitate close scrutiny and proactive planning.\n\n## Technical Aspects and Considerations\n\n### Impact on EC2 Instances, RDS, EKS, etc.\n\nThe new charging model impacts a broad array of resources, including EC2 instances, RDS, EKS, load balancers, and more. Managing complex architectures now entails a new layer of complexity, possibly requiring a reassessment of networking strategies and configurations.\n\n### The Complexity of Managing Multiple IP Addresses per Resource\n\nSome resources may have more than one public IPv4 address. Managing these involves not just technical configuration but also financial planning. Understanding how these multiple IPs interact within your infrastructure and contribute to overall costs is essential. \n\n### Discussion on the Feasibility and Challenges of Switching to IPv6\n\nThe move to IPv6 seems logical, but it's not devoid of challenges. Compatibility with services and APIs managed by others might become a hurdle. AWS has made progress, such as enabling communication from EC2 to Lambda functions over IPv6 (note that you cannot reach an EC2 instance from Lambda over IPv6), yet some cases may still hinder a complete switch.\n\n### IPv4 to IPv6 Transition Mechanisms\n\nDuring the transition, Network Address Translation (NAT), specifically NAT64, becomes vital. This mechanism translates IPv6 to IPv4 addresses, bridging communication between newer IPv6 systems and legacy IPv4 systems. Understanding and utilizing NAT64 is crucial for modernizing without losing functionality. Equally important is DNS64 which performs the translation at the DNS level. More specifically, in the case a domain is mapped only to an IPv4 address (i.e., it only has A records), DNS64 translates an A record (specific to IPv4) to an AAAA record (specific to IPv6), thus allowing an IPv6 client to reach an IPv4 server.\n\n### Proficiency with Security Groups and Other Network Considerations\n\nWith all IPv6 addresses being public, mastering security groups and leveraging egress-only internet gateways become even more critical. Properly configuring security rules and comprehending their interaction with different IP versions plays a significant role in upholding security and functionality within your network.\n\nThe new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a financial consideration. It intertwines with a multifaceted web of technical aspects that must be thoughtfully navigated. Embracing the right strategies and tools can pave the way for a seamless transition, preserving both efficiency and budget.\n\n## Security Implications\n\n### Reevaluation of Network Exposure\n\nThe new charges for public IPv4 addresses might encourage organizations to scrutinize network exposure more closely. Reducing the number of public IPs could be both a cost-saving measure and a strategy to enhance security by limiting the **attack surface.**\n\n### Importance of Secure Configuration in IPv6 Transition\n\nTransitioning to IPv6, while potentially cost-effective, demands careful consideration of security configurations. Understanding IPv6 security nuances is vital in safeguarding systems during and after the shift. While NAT64 facilitates communication between IPv6 and IPv4 systems, it also introduces unique security considerations. Proper implementation and continuous vigilance are required to ward off vulnerabilities that might arise during the translation process. In practice, most organizations will leverage the AWS NAT Gateway which already supports NAT64 and DNS64 (through Route 53) so our responsibility includes proper route configuration and keeping DNS resolvers up to date. However, other organizations might choose to deploy their own NAT instance to optimize cost.\n\n### Tools and Platforms for Security Management\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale can play a pivotal role in this secure transition. By providing insights into all public IP addresses, their attachments, and alternative communication paths, they can facilitate a more secure and cost-effective migration. Utilizing specialized security platforms and tools is fundamental to maintaining control over complex cloud environments.\n\nThis new AWS charging model for public IPv4 addresses is more than a technical and financial hurdle; it's an opportunity to rethink and potentially enhance security strategies. By understanding the interplay between IPv4 and IPv6, the role of the transition mechanisms, and the necessity of proper security configurations, organizations can navigate this transition without compromising security.\n\n## The Role of Cloud Security Platforms\n\nAutomated cloud security platforms like Cyscale are more than just a reactive measure to changes like AWS's new charging model for public IPv4 addresses; they represent a proactive approach to modern cloud infrastructure management. By providing tools that cut across cost optimization, security enhancement, migration planning, and collaboration, these holistic solutions enable organizations to thrive in an evolving cloud landscape."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM and Other Features You Never Knew Existed ","seoTitle":"Securing VMs in Google Cloud: Shielded VM","description":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","seoDescription":"Best practices for securing VMs in Google Cloud, including the Shielded VM feature description and practical steps to enable it.","date":"2023-08-23T15:16:04.584Z","featuredpost":true,"permalink":"securing-google-cloud-compute-shielded-vm","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/41be8/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/c78f7/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/2c0f5/51-cyscale-blog-min.jpg 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/913d0/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 205w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/91660/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 410w,\n/static/f8641a2b38562362996601473551a92f/888e2/51-cyscale-blog-min.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"While assessing the controls suggested by the CIS Benchmark 2.0.0 for Google Cloud, I stumbled upon an interesting recommendation: to launch compute instances with Shielded VM enabled. When you think of VM security, you think of open management ports, outdated OS versions, unencrypted VM disks and so on. So what is Shielded VM and why do you need to enable it ASAP? \n\n\n\n## Shielded VM \n\nShielded VM, in a cloud computing context, is a security solution that hardens VMs deployed in Google Cloud. This measure protects them against rootkits and bootkits, which are essentially malware that infect and obtain persistence in VMs, allowing attackers to infiltrate in the cloud environment through the Compute Instances. It’s like a magical portal into your entire cloud infrastructure, which, if created, opens on command for the hackers.    \n\nThe advantage of this setting is that, with just a few clicks, you significantly increase the protection of your [Google Cloud](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/) VM by providing it with: \n\n* Secure Boot, \n* vTPM, \n* Integrity monitoring. \n\n**Secure Boot** is a feature that verifies the digital signature of all boot components of a virtual machine. In this way, if any signature verification fails, that boot process is halted, thus ensuring that only authentic software is run on the system. This means that you cannot use any custom drivers on the machine, because if you do, it will cause the VM to not boot anymore. If a failure occurs, the user receives two errors:\n\n* **UEFI: Failed to load image**, and \n* **Status: Security Violation.** \n\n**vTPM, or Virtual Trusted Platform Module,** is a computer chip specialized in protecting secrets. To understand what vTPM is, let’s break it down. TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a hardware component that stores cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive data securely. By virtualizing it, the same result is achieved, but on a software level, meaning that VMs in the cloud can also be protected using a TPM, even though at hardware-level they may share components with other VMs. \n\nvTPM also introduces **Measure Boot**, a mechanism that checks the integrity of the VM’s components. When the VM first boots, Measure Boot establishes an **integrity policy** baseline by calculating hashes of the components, concatenating them and rehashing them into a final hash to guarantee a sound integrity monitoring. Then, every time the VM boots up, the hash is recalculated and checked against the initial one, thus being able to tell if there are any changes in the boot process. \n\nThe integrity policy baseline needs to be updated if changes appear, such as a system update. \n\nThrough the process described, **integrity monitoring** is achieved using Shielded VM and the Measure Boot mechanism. \n\n\n\n### How to enable Shielded VM \n\nTo enable Shielded VM, you can do it through the Google Cloud console, or using the Cloud shell.  \n\n**Using the Google Cloud console** \n\n1. Log in to your Google Cloud console and navigate to Compute Instances (or click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)). \n2. For each VM on which you want to enable the feature, follow these steps: \n\n   1. Click on the VM name to go to its details page.\n   2. On the upper right area of the page, select EDIT. \n   3. Scroll down to “Security and access” and check boxes accordingly to your desired settings. Please note that you cannot select “Integrity Monitoring” without checking “Turn on vTPM”, as Integrity monitoring is a feature provided by vTPM. \n\n**Using the Cloud shell** \n\n1. Stop the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances stop <instanceName>`\n\n2. Turn on vTPM and Integrity Monitoring: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vtpm --shieldedvm-integrity-monitoring`\n\n3. To also turn on Secure Boot (if you have no custom or unsigned drivers on the instance), add the *\\--shielded-vm-secure-boot* parameter to the previous command or execute the following command separately: \n\n`gcloud compute instances update <instanceName> --shielded-vm-secure-boot` \n\n4. After applying the changes, restart the instance: \n\n`gcloud compute instances start <instanceName>`\n\nNote that Shielded VM is not enabled by default on a VM. However, you can set an organizational policy that will cause all the future VMs to have Shielded VM enabled. To do that, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm).  \n\n\n\n#### Other configurations that you should consider for your Google Cloud VMs \n\nThere are some settings you should always check when assessing the security of a virtual machine. Here are just a few examples: \n\n* Use **confidential computing** to [encrypt in-use data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this way, your data that is processed, trained on, used, queried on your VMs remains encrypted and is not at risk. \n* **Close management ports** if not needed: RDP (3389), SSH (21), WINRM (5985), these are all open gateways for hackers to intrude in your VMs and further down your cloud environment. \n* **Apply patches, OS updates** and any other available updates on your VMs to keep them up to date with the current versions of software and ensure that you’re not leaving them vulnerable to found exploits. \n* **Do not use public IP addresses** for your Compute instances, if possible. Public IP addresses introduce the same vulnerability in your environment as management ports: you increase your attack surface and expose the VM to the Internet. Instead, use load balancers to “hide” your VMs. \n\nAlthough there are many aspects you should consider when setting up your cloud [infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) securely, use this article as a checklist to tick off some of the most important security configurations."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Cloud Security Strategy: Best Practices, Tutorials, and More","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Strategy: Best Practices & Tutorials ","description":"Explore the essentials of a robust cloud security strategy, blending best practices with hands-on tutorials.

With a myriad of cloud services at your fingertips, the potential for growth is immense. But with great power comes great responsibility. How do you ensure cybersecurity in this ever-evolving cloud environment? \n\nLet’s dive in and understand the cornerstones of a good cloud security strategy, while looking at some examples and tutorials for given [best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/). \n\n## Five Key Pillars of a Strong Cloud Security Strategy \n\n**1. Understanding Your Cloud Environment**: The diversity among cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure means security strategies should be tailored to each specific service. This requires a deep understanding of how workloads function in different environments, as well as a great visibility into your resources and the relations between them. \n\n**2. Addressing Vulnerabilities in Real-time**: Cyberattacks wait for no one. Security teams should be prepared to fix any findings right away. \n\n**3. Leveraging Automation and DevOps**: Automation in your cloud-native apps can reduce human errors (like misconfigurations) that lead to data breaches. Incorporating DevOps principles ensures security is baked into every step of the application lifecycle. \n\n**4. Zero Trust and Access Control**: The zero-trust model means never taking security for granted, even if the request comes from within your network. Coupled with stringent IAM policies, this ensures unauthorized access is blocked. \n\n**5. Continuous Evaluation and Monitoring**: Cybersecurity isn't static. Regularly review your policies and log and monitor your cloud environment to keep up to date with your configurations and be able to spot any suspicious behaviour. \n\n## Crafting a Roadmap with Examples and Tutorials \n\nLet’s look at some best practices and tutorials from major cloud providers to ensure a solid cloud security strategy: \n\n### 1. Obtain visibility  \n\nMicrosoft Defender provides behaviour analysis, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence for Azure environments. \n\nBy enabling this feature for different services that you use, you can improve visibility and learn more about your infrastructure, settings and user behaviour. Microsoft Defender is available for numerous Azure services, such as: \n\n* Containers, \n* Azure SQL Databases, \n* App Services, \n* Key Vaults, \n* Azure Cosmos databases, and many others. \n\nYou can enable Microsoft Defender either using the Azure CLI, the Azure portal, or Azure Powershell. For example, to enable Microsoft Defender for Key Vaults in the CLI, you can use the following command: \n\n```shell\naz security pricing create -n 'KeyVaults' --tier 'Standard'\n```\n\nTo do this for different services, replace ‘KeyVaults’ with ‘AppServices’, ‘Containers’, and others. \n\nPlease note that this feature incurs an additional cost per resource. \n\n### 2. Address vulnerabilities \n\nIt's not just about having a plan; it’s about knowing how to implement it correctly to prevent cyberattacks from being successful. I’ll show you something that you probably haven’t thought of when deploying VMs in Google Cloud. \n\nGoogle Cloud has a very useful feature for Compute Instances, which is called Shielded VM. By taking the extra step to enable this feature, you ensure that your virtual machines are hardened by a set of security measures that help defend against different types of malware. \n\nA pro tip would be setting an organizational policy to ensure that all new VMs will be created with the Shielded VM feature enabled. To do that, while logged in your Google Cloud console, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/compute-requireShieldedVm). You can also protect your already existent VMs. Cyscale provides detailed steps on how to do that and other ways of protecting your Compute Instances, which you can discover with [a free trial](https://cyscale.com/free-trial/). \n\n### 3. Automation is key\n\nI know you’ve heard this before.  But how do you actually automate configurations in the cloud? I will introduce you to a nice setting that can make your life easier when using Kubernetes in Google Cloud: automatic node repair!  \n\nIf a node inside a Kubernetes Cluster is not working correctly, Google Cloud knows to start a repair process for that node. This ensures that your environment is healthy and that nodes do not stop running. This automatic node repair is accomplished by the Kubernetes Engine, which makes periodic checks. \n\nTo enable automatic node repair for your Kubernetes Clusters, you can use the Google Console. In Kubernetes Engine, visit Clusters, and set “Automatic node repair” to “Enabled” for the clusters that you want to have this feature.  \n\n### 4. IAM is the new control plane \n\nSeriously, if your IAM policies and settings are not solid, your entire cloud environment may be in danger. Access control, a strong authentication process that includes MFA and strong passwords (in case you’re using them – passwordless authentication is also an option), the Least Privilege Principle... there’s so many to watch out for.  \n\nI will show you two quick commands for AWS that you just fire and forget, but that can have a great impact on your IAM security if they’re not implemented. \n\nI’m talking about password policies. Employees in your company are going to be tempted to use the same passwords over and over again across services and never change them. Using these two quick commands that I’m going to show you may prevent a breach in your organization: \n\n**Set IAM password policy expiry date within 90 days or less:** \n\n```shell\naws iam update-account-password-policy –max-password-age 90\n```\n\n**Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse (24 times):** \n\n```\naws iam update-account-password-policy –password-reuse-prevention 24\n```\n\nThat’s it. Run these commands and forget about them. Your [cloud infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure-security/) is a bit safer than a few moments ago. \n\n### 5. Get relevant logs \n\nSetting up a logging system is like walking on thin ice; you think everything is important, but when you see thousands of logs piling up, you end up feeling like nothing matters anymore. However, logging and monitoring is one of the key pillars in [multi-cloud security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) and must not be neglected.  \n\nIn Azure, you can create Log Alerts for specific events to ensure that you catch what matters to you. Are you worried that someone may create a bad policy assignment? Do you want to know when a network security group is updated, or if someone has deleted SQL Server Firewall rules? Fear not, you can granularly choose your battles and select which events are relevant for your company. \n\nThe easiest way to implement this is using the Azure CLI: \n\n```shell\naz monitor activity-log alert create --resource-group \"<resourceGroupName>\" --condition category=Administrative and operationName=Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/write and level=<verbose | information | warning | error | critical> --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>\" --name \"<activityLogRuleName>\" --subscription <subscriptionID> --action-group <actionGroupID>\n```\n\nSimply replace resourceGroupName, subscriptionID, activityLogRuleName, actionGroupID with the correct values. Notice that “operationName” contains the rule of the log alert. In this case, it is for the creation of Policy Assignments. You can change it; for example, if you want to monitor the deletion of a network security group, change to “networkSecurityGroups” and to “delete”, having operationName=Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete. \n\n## A Peek at Cyscale's Approach \n\nAt Cyscale, we're more than familiar with [cloud security challenges](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-challenges/).

The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds. As businesses move towards these multiple platforms, creating a comprehensive [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) becomes crucial.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud.

Effective cloud security solutions are becoming necessary as cloud-native infrastructure adoption grows.\n\nT﻿his article will look at a high-level overview of the steps needed to establish a security plan.\n\n## 1﻿. Risk assessment\n\nA﻿ successful security plan for cloud security must begin with a thorough risk assessment. The assessment should identify the following:\n\n* a﻿ny potential threats to the company's systems,\n* v﻿ulnerabilities, and\n* r﻿isks associated with the cloud environment.\n\nT﻿he [cloud assessment](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-assessment-vital-part-mergers-acquisitions/) should take into consideration the type of data stored in the cloud, the level of access granted to different users, and the efforts conducted to mitigate risks.\n\n## 2. Compliance frameworks \n\nAnother important component of a successful security plan is compliance frameworks. Compliance requirements can vary by industry and location, and businesses must ensure they follow relevant regulations and standards.  \n\nWell-known and accredited standards include: \n\n* GDPR,  \n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* PCI-DSS, \n* HIPAA, \n* DORA, \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), and others. \n\nCompliance frameworks provide guidelines and best practices for securing data and systems in the cloud environment.  \n\nEstablish which standard fits your business. For example, [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a framework related to information security that regulates credit and debit card transactions, while [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) is a federal law that defines rules regarding medical records and PHI. \n\n## 3. Incident response planning \n\nIncident response planning is also critical to a successful cloud security plan. An incident response plan outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or other incident. Some of the steps are: \n\n### 1﻿. Determine what caused the incident.\n\nF﻿inding the incident's cause is the first step in incident response. This could entail reviewing security rules and procedures, looking over employees interviews, and reviewing system logs.\n\n### 2﻿. Contain the incident\n\nT﻿he response team should take actions to contain the event after the incident's cause has been found. some actions include:\n\n* i﻿solating affected systems,\n* b﻿locking access to sensitive data, and\n* d﻿isabling compromised user accounts.\n\nT﻿his goal is to prevent the incident from spreading and causing further damage.\n\n### 3﻿. Notify affected parties\n\nT﻿he event must be reported to the affected parties as soon as possible. This may include:\n\n* c﻿ustomers,\n* e﻿mployees,\n* p﻿artners, and\n* r﻿egulatory bodies.\n\nT﻿he notification should contain:\n\n* i﻿nformation about the incident,\n* w﻿hat steps are being take to address it,\n* h﻿ow the incident can affect the stakeholders.\n\nT﻿he response team should also answer any questions that may arise, as well as provide ongoing updates as needed.\n\n### 4﻿. Conduct a root cause analysis\n\nT﻿he response team should carry out a root cause analysis to determine the incident's primary cause after it has been contained. This will aid in avoiding future similar incidents.\n\n### 5. Implement remediation measures\n\nThis may involve: \n\n* updating security policies and procedures,  \n* enhancing security controls, and  \n* providing additional employee training.  \n\nThe goal is to reduce the likelihood of future incidents and protect the organization's assets and reputation. \n\n## 4. Monitor and evaluate your plan \n\nAfter going through the previous stages and ensuring that your company has implemented the necessary best practices, you must monitor the security plan and ensure it works accordingly.  \n\nMoreover, the threat landscape constantly evolves, and businesses must remain vigilant to new threats and vulnerabilities. Therefore, even if you have a good security strategy, remain adaptive and ensure ongoing defense against new threats.  \n\nBusinesses may safeguard their sensitive information and assets, reduce the risk of security events, and ensure the continuity of company operations by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to cloud security.\n\nUpgrade your [cloud security strategy](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-strategy-best-practices-tutorials/) with our [Cloud Security Platform](https://cyscale.com/), a powerful tool offering comprehensive cloud inventory, advanced risk detection, multi-cloud support, and streamlined compliance processes to strengthen your business's cloud security posture."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","seoTitle":"Understanding serverless computing: how you can use it and how to secure it ","description":"Serverless computing is a collection of services provided by cloud vendors.

It allows users to write and execute code in the cloud without setting up the environment and allocating resources such as VMs beforehand. \n\nBenefits of serverless computing are: \n\n* **A pay-as-you-go model**, allowing code to only run when needed, \n* **No server management required**, since your code is running in the cloud, and you don't have to deal with the environment settings, \n* **Granular updates and patches** that allow developers to make changes at function-level and quickly deploy new versions, \n* **High reliability applications**, since the code runs on the cloud. \n\n## Services offered by cloud vendors \n\nTo further understand what serverless computing has to offer, we must look at services on the market and their features.  \n\n### 1. AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate \n\n**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that allows users, through functions, to run event-driven code without server provisioning or management. AWS Lambda can be used for: \n\n* File processing, \n* Stream processing, \n* Web and mobile applications, \n* IoT backends, and others. \n\nThe event-driven flows help reduce costs for users and add flexibility. Lambda functions are triggered by events, and customers only pay for the time the code is running.  \n\nMoreover, when creating a Lambda function, you can either start writing a function from scratch, or use sample code such as Amazon’s blueprints or the AWS Serverless Application Repository to implement your desired code. \n\n**AWS Fargate** is a compute engine that provides a serverless solution for application deployment by removing the need for infrastructure management. \n\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a service that allows Kubernetes instances to run both in the cloud and on-premises. EKS, together with AWS Fargate, produce a serverless solution for containers. \n\nFargate can also be used with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), with no additional changes required for your applications. \n\n### 2. Azure Serverless  \n\nMicrosoft Azure offers a collection of serverless compute solutions. Just like AWS Lambda, Azure Serverless enables its users to deploy code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.  \n\nSome of the Azure compute services are: \n\n* **Serverless Functions.** Just like AWS Lambda, Azure allows users to write event-driven code in their preferred language. Costs are applied only when the code is being executed, \n* **Serverless Kubernetes.** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), together with AKS virtual nodes, provide a serverless solution that reduces the infrastructure management workload of Kubernetes clusters. \n* **Serverless Containerized Microservices.** With this solution, applications are deployed in containers without managing the infrastructure,  \n* **Serverless Application Environments.** Using Azure App Service, web, mobile, and API applications are hosted in a fully managed environment.  \n\nAzure also provides low-code or no-code application development with Power Apps. This feature allows developers to construct applications using drag-and-drop functionalities, connectors, and readily-available solutions for common use cases. \n\n### 3. Cloud Run and Cloud Functions by Google Cloud \n\nThese two solutions offered by Google Cloud provide serverless compute services.  \n\n**Cloud Run** is an application development tool that separates infrastructure management from the code by placing applications in containers. Using Cloud Run, microservices can be deployed without specific configurations. It is highly scalable, and it can scale to zero – this means that if a service has no requests, all containers are removed, reducing costs. It supports the following programming languages: Go, Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, as well as others. \n\n**Cloud Functions** is a similar service to AWS Lambda and Azure Serverless. \n\n## Possible vulnerabilities of serverless computing \n\n### 1. Lack of source code security \n\nMany cyber attacks are successful due to poor code security.  \n\nAccording to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), one of the most common attacks on web applications in 2022 was SQL Injection. Whether an application is hosted in the cloud or not, user input should always be treated very carefully. \n\nTo correctly handle data received from users, you should sanitize it correctly and use prepared statements. \n\n### 2. Outdated or unpatched libraries, packages, and dependencies \n\nAnother element that affects applications' security is the libraries, packages, technologies, and dependencies used.  \n\nIn 2021, a critical vulnerability was discovered. Log4j, a popular Java framework used for logging messages in applications, introduced a massive flaw: it allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host machine. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-44228, commonly known as Log4Shell, [affected around 3 billion devices](https://www.acaglobal.com/insights/log4shell-vulnerability-what-we-know-and-action-steps-take).   \n\nServerless functions in the cloud were not immune to this attack. The functions written in Java that were using Log4j were vulnerable to Log4Shell. \n\nWhile not having to deal with underlying infrastructure management is an advantage of serverless computing, technologies used by developers still have to be used safely. \n\nHow do you protect your code from such vulnerabilities? \n\n* Only use trusted libraries, \n* Apply updates and patches as they appear, \n* Continuously assess your code, \n* Remove any unnecessary dependencies. \n\n### 3. Monitor your cloud infrastructure \n\nThis measure is a given. Log and monitor what your applications do to identify any odd behavior.  \n\nDocument every event that interacts with your code and see how your applications respond.  \n\n### 4. Integrate cryptography into your code \n\n[Encrypt sensitive data](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) to ensure confidentiality in your applications’ flow. You should encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest data using AES. \n\nMoreover, safely store secrets and keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or in your cloud using services such as: \n\n* Azure Key Vault,  \n* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS),  \n* Cloud Key Management Service in Google Cloud. \n\nDo not store keys, connection strings, or passwords in the source code or in plain text. \n\n### 5. Too much information is disclosed in error messages. \n\nWe’ve all encountered verbose error messages. \n\nDevelopers should not disclose information about errors or exceptions to the user. Instead, they should be handled in the code, and the message displayed should offer minimal explanations without revealing why the error occurred. \n\n  \n\nWhile writing code in the cloud and quickly deploying it without infrastructure management is tempting, you should be careful.  \n\nImplement the best practices recommended in this article to address serverless computing vulnerabilities and secure your cloud environment. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Andrei Ștefănie","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"A Word on Cloud Security","seoTitle":"A Word on Cloud Security","description":"Given all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen.

Or about security at all? Let’s zoom out even more and talk about the virtues we, as people, often desire for ourselves and look for in others. These include courage, compassion, generosity, temperance, persistence, and friendliness. As Brian Tracy points out in his excellent book, “No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline”, all these virtues depend on and are guaranteed by one of them: **integrity**. Just like this, our software products have multiple requirements including functional (it must solve specific problems) and non-functional (performance, availability, efficiency, etc.). All these depend on the trust our users have in our systems to keep their data safe; they depend on **security**.\n\nIn theory, the most secure software is the one that doesn’t exist. If you have nothing, there is nothing to worry about. In practice, you will probably want to achieve certain things, to deliver certain features within a reasonable timeframe and budget. Luckily for us, the cloud providers offer a sizeable suite of services that might help us. In the era of data-driven, microservices-based, global-scale systems, we end up using some of them for compute (e.g. EC2, AKS, GKE, Lambda, Cloud Run), storage (S3), business intelligence (Redshift, Power BI), integration (Pub/Sub, Kinesis, API Gateway, SQS, SNS, Azure Service Bus), and so on. AWS even offers a service that lets you make use of their (satellite) ground stations. If you are competing with Elon’s Starlink or you are building a weather forecasting system, you might find it useful\n\n## Great Power, Great Responsibility\n\nNaturally, you must understand how to configure each cloud service you end up using and make them work together. One fundamental concept provided by the cloud is the way you manage access. You have control over both the network (so the service is actually reachable or not) and IAM (whether the clients must have identities and sufficient permissions). On one end of the spectrum, you can leave everything open and hope everyone expects that you have it properly set up. On the other end, you can choose a very restrictive configuration that might slow down your team. This is often known as the tradeoff between security and usability (for your dev team in this case). Over the past few years, the industry started shifting more toward security introducing concepts such as zero trust security and SSO (please make use of it whenever possible; also, it’s a shame that some companies still provide SSO only with their enterprise plans).\n\nClassically, you had a number of VMs (on-premises, VPS), installed and configured UFW, set up SSH access, and sent the SSH keys to your colleagues. Now, you can configure public and **private** (sub)networks, connect your cloud networks to your on-premises networks, deploy load balancers, define firewall rules without ever SSH-ing into the VMs, and assign identities and permissions to the VMs (and any other compute service). If previously your team didn’t interact too much with the infrastructure side, **now the infrastructure is part of the application**.\n\n## Network Access\n\nStarting with configuring the network access, here you have multiple options to control it. Perhaps the simplest concept is making the resources public or private. Your VM might have a vulnerable OS version, but if nothing can reach it and it cannot reach the internet, the risk is considerably lower. Not only can you run most compute and database services in a private network, but you can also configure fully managed services to be accessible through the provider's internal network (without traversing the internet) by leveraging services such as [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) and [Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview).\n\nFurthermore, you can (have to) configure firewalls. Here the services vary a bit. Google Cloud calls them [VPC firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls). You define them at the VPC level and can optionally choose to which instances they should apply based on tags (they are not equivalent to AWS/Azure tags. In Google Cloud, the equivalent would be the resource labels) or service accounts (almost every resource can have an identity, which in Google Cloud, is given by service accounts). In AWS, you work with security groups that are assigned to virtual machines. Besides allowing traffic (by default everything is denied) from certain IP addresses or CIDRs, you can also choose based on the security group of the source (please make use of this). You can also achieve this in Azure, but you have to combine two types of resources: network security groups (these are the actual firewalls) and application security groups (you can associate these with the network tags from Google Cloud). In fact, here are the sources you can configure for each provider:\n\n* AWS: CIDRs, IP addresses, security groups, prefix lists (if you want to allow traffic coming only from certain AWS services)\n* Azure: CIDRs, IP addresses, application security groups, service tags (e.g. \\`AzureLoadBalancer\\`, \\`Internet\\`)\n* Google Cloud: CIDRs, IP addresses, network tags (defined on each instance), service accounts\n\nOf course, this is not all. You also have network access control lists (NACLs), firewalls specific to each service (especially managed databases from Azure), NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPNs, virtual appliances, traffic splitting, firewalls that you install on the VMs, and a lot more. All these bring considerable complexity and make it extra difficult to configure the optimal **effective network access**.\n\nAdditionally, while there are tools that check the traffic in real-time, these are often dealing with network paths that you defined and are aware of. There might be paths you did not intend to leave open that an attacker might make us for **lateral movement**.\n\n## IAM Access\n\nNot only can every member of your organization have a user (or multiple) with access to certain parts of your infrastructure, but so does almost every compute resource. Just like you provide John with permission to read data from a bucket, so you assign a role to a VM achieving the same access. The difference is that anything that runs on the VM and everyone who can access it (i.e. SSH into it) now can do everything the VM can do.\n\nFundamentally, this mechanism of assigning roles to resources is excellent. You have clear visibility of the principals (users, resources) that can access a given service, you can grant or revoke access at any moment, and you have a meaningful trail of access logs. The alternative is often based on keys/secrets and is almost impossible to trace properly because anyone that has the key can access the resource (it’s easy to lose track of who has the key) (secret scanners help a bit here but are limited to the resources they run on).\n\nWe just have to understand its implications. If attackers manage to break into a VM and if that VM has high (excessive?) permissions, the attackers will not only be able to access our data, but they will also be able to spin up additional instances (crypto mining?) and delete existing resources (service disruption and data loss).\n\nAgain, here it’s important to understand the effective permissions each resource has. There are multiple factors that contribute to the effective permissions such as the role assigned to the resource, permissions inherited from group memberships or from assignments at a higher level (the VM might be an owner at the subscription level in Azure thus having access to everything in that subscription), and policies configured on the target resources such as [resource policies in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) and [access policies for Azure Key Vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/security-features).\n\nAnother important aspect about effective permissions in the context of data access is encryption, especially encryption with customer-managed keys. For example, if you store data on S3 and encrypt it with a key managed by AWS KMS, you must have access to both the S3 bucket/object and the encryption key from KMS. Managing encryption keys deserves an article on its own.\n\n## The Human Factor\n\nEven if you have pristine infrastructure security, you still must provide access to someone (at least two admins so one doesn’t lock himself out by mistake - aka admin redundancy) to maintain the infrastructure and manage access for everyone else. This is an example of a highly privileged user. This in itself is not a major risk. However, if highly privileged users don’t have strong authentication mechanisms in place (MFA, preferably with strong factors), they can become liabilities. We are all subject to social engineering and phishing attacks.\n\nWhen you find out that an attacker managed to gain access to a highly privileged user, after revoking the sessions and rotating the credentials, you will want to find out the impact. For this, you need to know the systems to which the user has access. This can be quite challenging since the permissions are often spread across multiple systems.\n\nFor example, if you have Okta as the identity provider and AWS for the cloud infrastructure, you have to check both systems and link the results in order to determine what a person actually has access to. In Okta you just provide access to an application, but in AWS that application is often an AWS Organization with multiple accounts.\n\n## Ending Notes\n\nGiven all this complexity and the pace at which we are trying to deliver our products, it’s no surprise that breaches still happen. However, we can go fast and build secure systems. It’s not a zero-sum game. You probably have people in your organization that are naturally passionate about security. Give them the responsibility, the training, and the tools. You probably don’t need that many people to do security full-time since the tools are getting increasingly powerful.\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":9,"numPages":3,"currentPage":2,"category":"Cloud Security","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Expert Insights and Tips | Cyscale Blog","seoDescription":"Explore expert insights and practical tips on Cloud Security.
