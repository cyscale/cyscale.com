It usually stores sensitive information that should be well protected.  \n\nWhen we’re discussing databases in the cloud, there are two options for users. They can: \n\n* manage their own database in the cloud, or \n* use a service provided by their cloud vendor. \n\nThe latter is usually the easier choice since the cloud vendor takes care of security features.  \n\nHowever, your database may be vulnerable in both cases if you don’t configure your environment correctly. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for securing databases in the cloud and how to identify any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that may exist or appear in the future. \n\n## Best practices \n\n### 1. Filter inbound and outbound traffic. \n\nManaging traffic to and from the database is the first layer of database protection. Place databases behind firewalls and restrict the traffic allowed to reach them as much as possible. \n\nYou can implement more granular rules by only allowing a list of known IPs to connect to a database (for example, the range of addresses specific to a known data center), or by filtering traffic based on other criteria. \n\nMoreover, you can apply conditional access for users when administering the database. You can ask for additional security checks like Multi-Factor Authentication to ensure the entities managing the database are legitimate. \n\n### 2. Ensure availability through redundancy \n\nWhen deploying a database in the public cloud, you have the option to ensure availability through redundancy. You can replicate a database in different data centers and even different geographical regions. \n\nIf one data center or region fails, you can rely on a replication of the database located in a different data center to work. \n\n### 3. Encrypt your database \n\nDatabase [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) is important for protecting your data at rest.  \n\nEnsure that only authorized entities can see the data you’re storing in the database by [encrypting it ](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/)with a strong, recommended algorithm such as AES-256. Keep your encryption keys safe by storing them separately from the data, use strong generation algorithms and rotate them every 90 days or less. \n\n### 4. Secure your database connection \n\nNot only data at rest is vulnerable. When you're transferring data to and from the database, it is essential to encrypt your traffic.  \n\nThis is called encryption for data in transit and is implemented with the TLS/SSL protocols. \n\n### 5. Keep your connection details secret \n\nDo not disclose database connection strings, keys, certificates, and other secrets that may be used to breach your database. You can use cloud solutions to keep your cryptographic secrets safe: \n\n* [Azure](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/azure-cloud-security/) Key Vault, \n* [AWS ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/)Key Management Service (AWS KMS), \n* [Google Cloud ](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/gcp-cloud-security/)Secret Manager, \n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), and others. \n\n### 6. Log connection attempts \n\nKeep track of who is trying to connect to your database by logging any authentication attempts. In this way, you can see if: \n\n* someone unauthorized is trying to or is connecting to the database, \n* there is a brute-force attack taking place.  \n\n### 7. Perform regular database backups \n\nDatabases should be backed up regularly, to prevent loss of data, in the case of: \n\n* Data corruption, and \n* Ransomware attacks. \n\nAlthough ransomware attacks are less common in cloud environments at the moment, attackers could in time develop the proper tactics. \n\n![RPO and RTO](/img/20_blog-rpo-and-rto.webp#shadow \"RPO and RTO\")\n\nThe time between the backups is known as RPO (Recovery Point Objective). It is measured as the time that passed between the last backup and the current one. If a disaster appears, the data written in that time is lost. \n\nRTO (Recovery Time Objective) is the time it takes for an application to go back online after a disaster and to restore its data.   \n\nRTO and RPO should be kept in acceptable limits. \n\n \n\nIt is difficult to ensure you’re implementing all the best practices we mentioned in this article. [Cyscale ](https://cyscale.com/)has over 400 controls that can help you secure your entire cloud environment. \n\nHere are some examples of controls that check for any misconfigurations and vulnerabilities regarding your database setup in the public cloud: \n\n* *Ensure encrypted storage is used for VMs that might host a database* for AWS \n* *Ensure no SQL Databases allow ingress 0.0.0.0/0 (ANY IP)* for Microsoft Azure \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances require all incoming connections to use SSL* for Google Cloud \n* *Ensure parameter 'log_connections' is set to 'ON' for PostgreSQL Database* for Alibaba Cloud \n\nAlong with these controls that alert you on any findings, you receive remediation steps to quickly eliminate any vulnerabilities and secure your database in the cloud. \n\n \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Protecting Data at Rest Using Encryption  ","seoTitle":"Protecting Data at Rest Using Encryption  ","description":"Data at rest is data that is not currently used or transmitted between computer systems.

Data at rest can be stored in: \n\n* Storage cloud assets such as buckets, \n* Databases, \n* Files, and others. \n\nThe most common method of protecting data at rest is through [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this article, we will look at ways to perform encryption and understand its importance. \n\n## Why is it important to encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are three main risks regarding data at rest: \n\n* loss,  \n* leakage,  \n* theft. \n\nIn all three cases, your data at rest will probably end up in somebody’s hands. You can forget your USB drive in a coffee shop, you can accidentally disclose your data to someone else or the public or it can be stolen by a malicious attacker. \n\nFor these reasons, a safeguarding mechanism is encrypting your data. \n\nWith this method, even if someone else gets ahold of your data, they will not be able to read it. \n\n## Client-side and server-side encryption \n\nClient-side encryption is done on a local device with the user's key. \n\nServer-side encryption is implemented in the cloud, and the cloud vendor usually takes care of the key. This method of encryption is easier to use, since the cloud provider takes care of the algorithm, the key management system, and other troubles you may have. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for client-side encryption, as well as solutions offered for server-side encryption.  \n\n## How do you encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are a few best practices that need to be considered when undergoing the encryption process: \n\n### 1. Use an industry-recommended standard with an appropriate key length. \n\nFor data at rest, symmetric encryption algorithms are usually used. An industry-recommended standard is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 2. Classify data and decide what to encrypt. \n\nMake sure you don’t leave any sensitive data unencrypted. Use [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) to decide what data should be encrypted.  \n\nAlternatively, perform full disk encryption to protect all data, especially in case you lose the hardware. \n\n## Key management \n\nNow that we’ve established how to encrypt data at rest, let’s talk keys.  \n\nIf your key management is poor, no matter how strong and well-done an encryption is, it can become totally useless. \n\nFollow the best practices we’re recommending to ensure textbook key management.  \n\n### 1. Use a random key generation algorithm for your keys.  \n\nMost random number generator algorithms are not truly random; they are called Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs).  \n\nIf you’re using programmatic functions such as random() or rand() from C++, Java, and other languages, you’re not generating random keys; they use a seed (which always gives the same result), can be predicted, and are not for cryptographic usage. \n\nFor this reason, you need to use tools that utilize Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs). \n\nTo generate a random, secure key, you can use: \n\n* [GenerateRandom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html), a tool provided by AWS, \n* the [GenerateRandomBytes](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/generate-random) API from Google Cloud, \n* [SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html), a class from Java, and others. \n\n### 2. Store your keys separately from your ciphertext. \n\nDo not store your keys in the same place as encrypted data, and do not hardcode them in the source code. You can use: \n\n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware security modules (HSM), \n* key management systems such as Azure Key Vault and AWS KMS, \n* open source KMS such as HashiCorp Vault. \n\n### 3. Rotate the keys. \n\nChange the keys regularly (every 90 days or less). This process involves retiring an encryption key and generating a new one. \n\nMoreover, if a key is compromised, immediately replace it and assess which data is at risk. \n\n### 4. Implement access control for keys \n\nEnsure that access to keys is heavily restricted in the following ways: \n\n* [Implement the Least Privilege Principle.](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) Only the individuals that need the keys should be able to access them. You can also implement time windows when keys can be accessed. \n* Only authorized personnel should be able to access keys. Ensure that, after you’ve granted access rights to people, only they can see and use the keys. \n\n###  5. Manage key deletion \n\nIf a key is permanently deleted, all data encrypted with that key is lost. The key should be appropriately destroyed after all the encrypted data is decrypted and re-encrypted with a new key. \n\nSolutions from cloud vendors for safe key deletion are: \n\n* Soft delete in Azure Key Vault, \n* Key deletion scheduling in AWS. \n\n## Server-side encryption - cloud solutions \n\nAWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide data at rest encryption and key management solutions. Let's look at the available options and how to make sure you're using them correctly. \n\n### Encryption in AWS \n\nThe following services in AWS support data at rest encryption capabilities: \n\n* Amazon EBS, \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift, \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nKey management is done using the AWS Key Management Service, which allows users to utilize their own keys or let AWS deal with them. \n\n### Encryption in Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, users have the following options: \n\n* Azure Disk Encryption, for Virtual Machines, \n* Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database, which encrypt all data at rest. \n\nFor key management, Azure provides the following services: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM). \n\n### Encryption in Google Cloud \n\nFor key management, Google Cloud provides the Google Key Management Service. As an additional layer of security, the encryption key, named DEK (Data Encryption Key), is also encrypted using a KEK (Key-encryption key).  \n\n## How do you check for encryption misconfigurations? \n\nAs we’ve seen, there are many best practices to be considered, and therefore there is room for mistakes. \n\nYou can quickly [check for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) regarding data at rest encryption in the cloud using Cyscale’s controls. Here are a few examples of controls that check if you’re implementing the best practices described in this article: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure storage for critical data are encrypted with Customer Managed Key* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure EBS encryption by default is enabled* for AWS, \n* *Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest* for AWS. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","seoTitle":"5 Hybrid Cloud Best Practices ","description":"A Hybrid Cloud infrastructure contains at least two different environments, which can be on-premises, in the public cloud and in a private cloud.

If you efficiently distribute workloads, you can significantly decrease latency and become more efficient. \n\n#### Higher flexibility \n\nHaving so many technologies integrated into your workflow can help you with flexibility. For example, you can choose where each type of data is stored. \n\nMoreover, by hosting your applications in the cloud using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, they become **portable** and can be moved across environments. \n\n#### Increased scalability \n\nCompared to on-premises systems, hybrid cloud is more scalable because of its cloud component. \n\nYou can quickly scale up and acquire more resources in the cloud without having to purchase any equipment. \n\n### Disadvantages \n\n#### Increased complexity \n\nDue to increased complexity, it is harder to secure and manage your application’s resources and workloads. Working with at least three different environments (on-premises, private and public cloud) can increase the chance of making mistakes in terms of security (and not only). \n\n#### Higher costs \n\nOne of the public cloud's most significant advantages is that it is usually the cheapest alternative to keeping up servers on-premises. However, hybrid cloud architecture uses both, increasing costs. \n\n## Hybrid Cloud Best Practices \n\nWe’ve composed a list of best practices to tick off when constructing and assessing your hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these may be applicable to companies that use cloud environments (and not hybrid ones) as well. \n\n#### 1. Have a robust cloud security posture, secure your on-premises servers, and ensure endpoint security. \n\nIn order to secure an infrastructure that uses hybrid cloud, besides managing your [cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/), you need to ensure your devices are secured. On-premises devices should: \n\n* be updated regularly, \n* be protected by antiviruses and firewalls. \n\n#### 2. Implement the Least Privilege Principle. \n\nThe Least Privilege Principle states that no user should be given more permissions than required. This practice helps minimize the risk of data breaches or accidental misconfigurations. \n\nMake sure you implement this principle across all platforms and devices.  \n\nTo do this, restrict access to the lowest privilege every user needs and eliminate all root and administrator accounts that are not strictly necessary. \n\n#### 3. Monitor your environment. \n\nMonitoring is essential to detecting any misconfigurations or malicious actions in your company.  \n\nKeep logs of everything that happens in your infrastructure and use targeted alerts to help you respond quickly to the most important events. \n\n#### 4. Perform regular audits and comply with international standards. \n\nIt is important to be compliant with international standards and acquire their accreditations. In this way, you ensure that you: \n\n* manage customer data safely, \n* have a good reputation since you show that you recognize the importance of information security, \n* avoid fines and other financial consequences. \n\nTo achieve compliance, you must implement proper data handling in both on-premises and cloud environments. \n\nInternational standards that define rules and regulations that apply to the hybrid cloud are: \n\n* [PCI-DSS,](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/) \n* HIPAA, \n* SOC 2, \n* ISO 27001, and others. \n\n#### 5. Perform backups \n\nSince the on-premises infrastructure is a part of the hybrid cloud, it is essential to perform regular backups.  \n\nPublic cloud vendors provide backup services for your cloud assets. Some solutions are: \n\n* Azure Backup, \n* AWS Backup, \n* Actifio Go, for Google Cloud. \n\nTo back up your on-premises devices, establish a disaster recovery strategy and store backups separately from on-premises equipment. \n\n## How can Cyscale improve your hybrid cloud infrastructure? \n\nUse Cyscale’s policy engine to create policies for your entire infrastructure and effortlessly follow the best practices described in this article. \n\nThe policies you establish can be used for both on-premises and public cloud environments. \n\nMoreover, for your public cloud infrastructure, you can achieve robust security when using Cyscale, by: \n\n* becoming [compliant with international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/) with less effort and time, \n* checking your cloud’s configurations and eliminating any vulnerabilities using over 500 controls and policies available across the most important cloud vendors,  \n* receiving targeted alerts that let you locate critical misconfigurations in no time, \n* receiving remediation steps to fix findings. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","seoTitle":"What Is Data Classification And Why Is It Important?","description":"Data classification is a way of grouping data to ensure easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.

Risk management \n\nAccording to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification-overview.html), data classification is a foundational step in cybersecurity risk management. The reason behind this is that applying labels to data and establishing security requirements such as: \n\n* the level of confidentiality,  \n* the need for integrity checking,  \n* the sensitivity of data, \n\ncan help your company manage risks efficiently. \n\n#### 2. Compliance \n\nWhen implementing compliance with [international standards](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/), you must know what type of data your company is managing and storing.  \n\nData classification should be done correctly to understand which of the data you're storing is confidential/sensitive. You cannot comply with recognized frameworks unless you correctly handle confidential data (and you cannot do this unless you know which data is confidential). \n\nLet’s look at a **scenario** – if you’re storing customer [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/), but you are not aware of the criticality of that data, you may not even think of protecting it, for example, by encrypting it. \n\nTherefore, your company may not be compliant with standards like: \n\n* SOC 2,  \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/),  \n* GDPR, and others. \n\n#### 3. Security \n\nOrganizing data into categories and using labels can help you maintain: \n\n* **confidentiality**, because you will turn your focus to the most sensitive data, \n* **integrity**, because you can mark the need for integrity as high for some data using labels, \n* **availability**, which can be explicitly ensured for data that needs to be highly available and is labeled as such. \n\n<br/>\n\nMuch of the data that used to be saved on-premises is now saved and processed in the cloud, in databases, assets of type storage, and others.  \n\nTherefore, data classification should be used in the cloud. Let’s look at what the cloud industry offers to help you easily and accurately classify your data. \n\n## Data classification – an industry overview \n\nWe will look at the top 3 cloud vendors – AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – to see how data classification is implemented and the different types of tags that can be applied depending on the cloud service selected. \n\n#### 1. Amazon Web Services \n\nIn the AWS documentation, a three-tiered classification is recommended, with the following tag names: \n\n* Unclassified, \n* Official, \n* Secret and above. \n\nMoreover, AWS presents the following three labels used by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a United States government agency, and recommends them: \n\n* Low,  \n* Moderate, \n* High, \n\nwhich classify the impact a potential data breach would cause on that data.  \n\nHowever, these tags are recommendations and users can implement their own tags. Later in this article, you will find best practices on how to implement labeling for your cloud environment. \n\nWhen you create a resource in AWS, you can add tags (key-value pairs) to the resource to associate it to labels used in data classification. \n\n#### 2. Google Cloud Platform\n\nFor data classification in Google Cloud, we can find both labels and tags, which are two different things.  \n\nA label is described as a key-value pair that you can create using the Resource Manager API and the Google Cloud console. These can be used to separate resources in terms of billing, to add information about resource state, and so on. \n\nTags, however, are the tools that allow Google Cloud customers to classify data and establish rules based on their classification. \n\nThe difference between labels and tags in Google Cloud is that labels are simply metadata added to resources, while tags categorize assets and can be used when defining policies and rules (for example, who is allowed to access a certain asset) in your Google Cloud environment. \n\n#### 3. Microsoft Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, we can use the Microsoft Purview service to ensure data labeling of cloud assets.  \n\nMicrosoft Purview is a solution offered by Microsoft that brings together your cloud, on-premises, and SaaS data and helps you manage it through different solutions: \n\n* Data Map, \n* Data Catalog,  \n* Data Sharing, \n* Data Estate Insights, and others. \n\nAn important aspect is that Data Map powers most of the solutions offered by Microsoft Purview and is a paid service. \n\nIn terms of data classification, there are a few services that can help you manage your cloud resources: \n\n* the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog uses sensitivity labels that can be added to cloud assets. \n* the Microsoft Purview Information Protection service, which has the following features: data classification, trainable classifiers, sensitive information types, \n* the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, a downloadable client that also provides sensitivity labels.  \n\nMicrosoft Azure suggests that you apply tags that contain additional information about resources (do not include any PII or sensitive data in the tags) to: \n\n* add context to your resources and understand them better,  \n* be able to use complex filters. \n\nAzure also suggests a “Data classification” tag to describe the sensitivity of data stored or processed by a resource. If an organization does not have their own labels defined, they may use the following values supplied by Microsoft: \n\n* Non-business, \n* Public, \n* General, \n* Confidential, \n* Highly confidential. \n\nMoreover, Azure recommends that you also use a formal data classification process. In the next section, we will explain best practices to keep in mind when classifying your resources. \n\n## How do you implement data classification? \n\nAn important rule to follow when implementing data classification is that the entire organization should use the same classification tags/labels. Using a policy or a procedure for this process that regulates: \n\n* the classification process as a whole, \n* the tags’ names, and others \n\nis essential to ensuring consistent data classification. \n\nIn Cyscale, you can find the out-of-the-box “Data Management” policy, which contains the “Data Classification” procedure to guide you in this process. Moreover, you can create your own custom policy with any specific rules you want to add. \n\n<br/>\n\nConsidering the benefits of data classification, implement this feature for your cloud environment. Use a company-level classification policy and add tags to your cloud assets to enable easy sorting, retrieval, and prioritization.  \n\nIn [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), you can use this feature to:  \n\n* easily filter assets based on tags,  \n* highlight any irregularities regarding your most sensitive assets, and  \n* prioritize remediation for the most urgent findings.  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Cloud Security"],"title":"Protecting PII in the Cloud","seoTitle":"Protecting PII in the Cloud ","description":"PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information about an individual that can be directly tied to that person’s identity.

PII can be used with or without other data to identify an individual. \n\nExamples of Personally Identifiable Information are: \n\n* name, \n* social security number, \n* biometric records, \n* unique personal document numbers such as passport or driver’s license number, \n* medical, educational, financial history, and many others. \n\nPII information can be categorized into two parts: \n\n1. Linked information. This type of data can on its own single out an individual. \n2. Unlinked information. A person cannot be directly traced based on it, but if combined with another piece of information it could identify an individual. Some examples are: \n\n* city, \n* gender, \n* age range, \n* race. \n\n## What data is considered non-PII? \n\nData that cannot be used to pinpoint a person is considered non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). \n\nSome examples of non-PII information are: \n\n* data collected by browsers and devices such as device type, browser type, language preference, screen size, \n* aggregated statistics, \n* IP addresses. \n\n## What happens if PII is breached? \n\nIdentity theft is one of the biggest threats involving PII.  \n\nWhat can an attacker do with a target’s PII? They can, in their victim’s name: \n\n* Open accounts, \n* File for tax refund, \n* Claim unemployment benefits, \n* Use health insurance, \n* Take out loans, and many others. \n\nThese actions are very serious and can occur without the victim’s knowledge. \n\n## PII in the Cloud \n\nThere are several standards that regulate the management of PII in the cloud: \n\n* NIST, \n* HIPAA, \n* GDPR, \n* ISO 27002, and others. \n\nA few safety guidelines regarding PII have been established by these standards, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personally-identifiable-information-pii.asp): \n\n1. Some of the sensitive information must be stored only in extreme situations. \n2. Delete PII if it is not needed for its stated purpose. \n3. Do not share PII with parties that do not guarantee its protection. \n4. Report if a PII breach occurs. \n\n## How do you safely handle PII in the Cloud? \n\nAccording to [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-07-28-IBM-Report-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Hits-Record-High-During-Pandemic), PII was the most costly type of data lost in data breaches in 2021, averaging at around 180USD/record lost. \n\nThere are a few safety precautions that can be taken to increase the safety of private data in the cloud. \n\n#### 1. Implement strong password policies \n\nMake sure that your organization only allows strong passwords and that they are not re-used. This best practice helps prevent someone from gaining access to the PII in the cloud. \n\n#### 2. Encrypt the data \n\nEncryption is an essential step to securing the PII. Use industry-recommended encryption algorithms and robust key management.  \n\nThis reduces the risk of a data breach in case an attacker gains access to the data stored in the cloud. \n\n#### 3. Tokenize PII \n\nAlongside encryption, tokenizing personally identifiable information is another measure to keep it secure.  \n\n**Tokenization** works by mapping the PII to a token (which can be, for example, a unique string of characters) that on its own does not mean anything, and storing that token instead of the data. \n\nIf the token is leaked, the attacker has to obtain its pair, the PII. However, the actual information is usually stored in a tokenization manager that will only disclose the data to authorized entities. \n\n#### 4. Only keep necessary information \n\nAnother obvious way to keep data secret is to simply not store it; make sure you’re not keeping any non-essential PII and correctly dispose of it.  \n\n#### 5. Comply with The Least Privilege Principle \n\nMake sure no employee has more privileges than they need; this helps keep the PII exposure at a minimum, thus increasing its safety. \n\n## Who is responsible for PII? \n\nEvery person should be very cautious when asked to provide any kind of PII. \n\nWhen we’re discussing PII stored in the cloud, the organization storing it is responsible with the safety of the private data they are holding. \n\nIf GDPR compliant, companies assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who oversees the manipulation of data and ensures compliance.  \n\nThe DPO is responsible with making sure that PII is stored correctly. \n\n### How can Cyscale help you with protecting PII in the cloud? \n\nHere’s how: \n\n* It uses controls that automatically alert you if you’re not implementing the rules, guidelines, and best practices recommended by international standards, \n* It provides you with remediation steps to fix misconfigurations regarding PII in the cloud, \n* Cyscale helps you become compliant with international standards and prove to your customers that you’re responsible and handling PII safely. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":9,"skip":18,"numPages":3,"currentPage":3,"category":"Cloud Security","seoTitle":"Cloud Security Expert Insights and Tips | Cyscale Blog","seoDescription":"Explore expert insights and practical tips on Cloud Security.
