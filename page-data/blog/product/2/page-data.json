If you have users in Okta and IAM users in the cloud, you will have to assess their configurations in two different systems, resulting in more work and more room for mistakes. \n\nChecking for common configurations, for example, whether MFA is enabled for all users, can result in steps that need to be completed in two different places. \n\nHowever, when using Cyscale, all you need to do is to perform the onboarding once for both the cloud account and the Okta account.  \n\nYou will be able to monitor security posture for access management in one single place. \n\nThis will reduce the risk of mistakes and make your work more efficient. \n\n### Okta controls – what are they, and how can they help you?\n\nOnce you have integrated your [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) account in Cyscale, a broad range of controls automatically check your configurations and alert you if there are any findings. \n\nLet’s look at some of these controls and what they do: \n\n#### 1. Ensure at least two Okta admins are configured.  \n\nThis control is based on the Principle of Separation of Duties; it checks that there is more than one user with administrative privileges in order to eliminate a single point of failure.  \n\n#### 2. Ensure application assignments are configured through groups \n\nAccess to applications configured with Okta can be assigned directly or through groups. It is recommended that access is assigned through groups because it ensures that: \n\n* no users are mistakenly given access to applications, and  \n* managing multiple users is more efficient. \n\n#### 3. Ensure all users have MFA configured.  \n\n[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) is an essential security feature and should not be overlooked when implementing authentication. \n\n#### 4. Ensure MFA is configured with strong factors.  \n\nModerate to strong MFA factors include: \n\n* SMS/Voice/Email \n* Push notifications, \n* WebAuthn, \n* YubiKey OTP. \n\nWeak factors, which are not recommended for MFA implementation, are: \n\n* Passwords \n* Security questions \n\n#### 5. Ensure there are no weak password policies.  \n\nApplying strict policies on passwords by establishing rules that cover all corner cases, such as: \n\n* the minimum password length, \n* the type of characters allowed, \n* the usage of both upper-case and lower-case characters, \n\nis an essential configuration. \n\n### More context with Okta \n\nLet’s look at the following **scenario**: an Okta administrator provisions an [AWS](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/aws-cloud-security/) SSO user with administrator privileges.  \n\nThe administrator from Okta does not have MFA activated, or they may have a weak password if the Okta password policy is not strong enough.  \n\nCyscale provides a broader context for access management provisioning, emphasizing risks.  \n\nThe scenario described above can easily go unacknowledged if a CSPM does not have integration with Okta. \n\n### The identity page – a unified view to see everything in one place \n\nCyscale offers a powerful Identity Dashboard where you can see in one combined view all of the identities from your organization and the level of access they have in multiple systems. \n\nYou can check out a preview of the Identity Dashboard in the image below: \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/1_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nAfter expanding any of the identity rows from the illustration, we can now see the accounts an entity has access to, along with their level of privilege and other important information that you should not miss. \n\nBy integrating with an identity provider, Cyscale offers more context and a better understanding of configurations and risks. \n\nFor example, in the view below, it is easy to take note of identities in your organization that present the most risk. \n\n![The identity page in Cyscale](/img/2_blurred.webp#shadow \"The identity page in Cyscale\")\n\nThe Okta integration is very well rounded for AWS, and more support will be available soon for other providers as well.  \n\n### What is next? \n\nWe know how important visibility is in the cloud. Having all users in one place and being able to visualize access in a unified view can significantly improve discovery and visibility. After Okta, there are more identity providers to come in [Cyscale](https://cyscale.com/), for example: \n\n* Azure AD, \n* JumpCloud, \n* G-suite, and others. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Ovidiu Cical","categories":["Product"],"title":"Introducing the next level of security, by Cyscale","seoTitle":null,"description":"We're on a mission to enhance your business, so get ready to embrace the digital future and secure your apps & data in a multi-cloud world!","seoDescription":null,"date":"2020-07-15T07:05:00.000Z","featuredpost":false,"permalink":"next-level-of-cloud-security","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/mockup.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/757a5/mockup.webp","srcSet":"/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/eb5f1/mockup.webp 205w,\n/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/81adf/mockup.webp 410w,\n/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/757a5/mockup.webp 820w,\n/static/14a00fe11dd255df8ac621a5f5e35f40/1a51a/mockup.webp 1640w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":820,"height":495}}}},"rawMarkdownBody":"\n### Dear friend, get ready to secure your apps & data in a multi-cloud world.\n\n#### The era of remote work and cloud computing is here, and we're excited to share that you can experience enhanced cloud security right from your Cyscale account.
