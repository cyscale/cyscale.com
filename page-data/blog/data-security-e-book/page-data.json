The convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness they offer have seen the rise of a multi-cloud world where enterprises deploy workloads across diverse cloud environments - be it AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private clouds.  \n\nThis landscape, however, has also increased the attack surface for cyber threats, bringing the conversation to the forefront: cloud infrastructure security.  \n\n## What is Cloud Infrastructure Security? \n\nCloud infrastructure security concerns the protocols, controls, procedures, and technologies designed to protect data, workloads, and systems housed on cloud platforms. This security domain aims to guard against issues such as: \n\n* misconfigurations,  \n* malware,  \n* unauthorized access, and  \n* data loss,  \n\nwhich threaten sensitive data and business continuity. \n\nSome of the domains of cloud infrastructure security include: \n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) \n\nThis involves the use of authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to cloud resources. IAM systems: \n\n* restrict permissions,  \n* prevent unauthorized access, and  \n* maintain zero-trust principles. \n\nA few best practices I always recommend to [secure IAM](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/\") and ensure no unwanted access is allowed are: \n\n* complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* enabling MFA for users, \n* integrating Single Sign-On (SSO), \n* rotating credentials and keys regularly and consistently, and others. \n\n### 2. Data Security \n\nProtects data in transit or at rest on the cloud, reducing risks of data breaches or loss. Data security measures include encryption of data, frequent backups, access control, and others. For more details, read my article on [cloud security and compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/\"). \n\n### 3. Workload Protection \n\nSecurity controls protect operating systems, middleware, and applications running on virtual machines within the cloud environment.  \n\nVulnerability management, access control, network segmentation, logging and monitoring are considerations that you should take into account when ensuring workload protection.  \n\nFor example, vulnerability management means identifying existent vulnerabilities documented in CVEs that may affect your workload and ensuring that the existent software versions and configurations do not introduce vulnerabilities in your cloud environment. \n\nBesides VMs, containers and serverless functions should also be scanned for vulnerabilities and included in your company’s workload protection program. \n\n### 4. Network Security \n\nThis domain utilizes: \n\n* firewalls,  \n* network security groups (NSGs), \n* intrusion detection systems, and  \n* secure connectivity protocols to guard the cloud network against threats. \n\nFor example, blocking SSH and RDP on VMs are common best practices. If traffic on these ports is not explicitly required, it should be restricted to reduce the attack surface of your cloud environment. \n\n### 5. Incident Response \n\nThis encompasses strategies and tools for real-time threat detection, remediation, mitigation, and post-incident analysis, ensuring prompt recovery after an attack. \n\nLet’s analyze the example from the previous section; if an attacker leverages an open SSH port, and they manage to connect to a VM, that’s a huge threat; at this point, a good incident response plan can make the difference between data loss or a swift recovery. \n\nHere’s how an incident response would look like: \n\n1. **Detection.** Let’s say the attacker brute-forced their way into a VM using SSH. You can detect this activity by carefully watching logs and detecting numerous incorrect attempts to log in through SSH.  \n2. **Remediation.** Adding an NSG rule that denies SSH traffic to that machine is the way to go; unless absolutely necessary, that service should be not be reachable from the Internet. Moreover, in this situation, that machine should be temporarily isolated to prevent the entire system from being compromised. \n3. **Mitigation.** I would recommend resetting the SSH password as well as passwords for other accounts. \n4. **Post-incident analysis.** Examining the VM and seeing if any changes have been made to it are essential steps after containing the incident. If sensitive data was stored on that machine and an attacker could have had access to it, involved parties should be notified. \n\n## How to Secure Your Cloud Infrastructure: More Best Practices \n\nThe most critical step toward achieving robust cloud infrastructure security is adopting security best practices. By leveraging proven strategies and state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure security tools, businesses can safeguard their cloud environment and uphold the integrity of their operations. \n\nLet's walk through some key practices: \n\n### 1. Implement a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Solution  \n\nA [CSPM tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/\") helps identify and remediate security misconfigurations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the cloud environment and automates security checks, drastically reducing the attack surface. \n\n### 2. Secure Your Cloud Native Applications \n\nAs DevOps principles are leveraged to create and deploy applications, you must secure the application throughout its lifecycle. This includes design, deployment, and updates. [CNAPP security](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/\") provides such protection, facilitating secure software development and deployment. \n\n### 3. Adopt a Multi-Cloud Data Security Strategy \n\nIn multi-cloud environments, managing data security can be challenging due to the different architectures and security policies of cloud providers. A [multi-cloud data security](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/\") strategy provides comprehensive security across multiple clouds and aids in compliance. If your company has a multi-cloud infrastructure, I would recommend using a CSPM or a CNAPP tool; bringing your inventory, configurations and other info about your cloud in one single platform can make it so much more manageable for your cloud security team. \n\n### 4. Ensure Compliance with Regulatory Standards  \n\nAdherence to regulatory standards and best practices is key. A [cloud compliance platform](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-compliance-and-auditing/\") ensures you meet required security benchmarks such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and facilitates routine audits to maintain your security posture. \n\nFor a deeper dive into these strategies, we recommend reading our guide on [cloud data security best practices](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/ \"https\\://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/\"). \n\n## FAQs on Cloud Infrastructure Security \n\n<ul class=\"faq-list\"><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are the levels of cloud infrastructure security? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud infrastructure security spans multiple levels - from containers and network connections to the data and applications hosted on the cloud. Each level requires specific security controls to guard against cyber threats. </p></li><li><p class=\"question\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What are cloud security types? </p><p class=\"answer\">Cloud security types typically correspond with cloud service models – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

In this article, we will discuss all the deadlines by which you have to become compliant, details about the new requirements, and everything else you need to know about PCI DSS version 4.\n\n## Timeline and deadlines\n\nPCI DSS version 4 appeared at the end of March 2022 and its requirements will become mandatory in two phases: the first one is March of 2024, and the final one is March of 2025.\n\nThe new version brings considerable changes, but most of the new requirements will not be mandatory until 2025. However, companies that manage to fulfill them before 2025 can audit them.\n\nThe old version, PCI DSS 3.2.0., will remain active until the 31st of March, 2024, to allow companies enough time to recertify with the new version.\n\n## Changes in PCI DSS version 4, explained\n\nNew requirements have been added to all of the categories to better reflect the current cybersecurity landscape. Some examples of areas covered by the new requirements include the authentication process, logging and monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and others.\n\nMost of the sections have been revised or contain new requirements.\n\nPCI DSS is structured into twelve requirements, and each contains its own sections. The requirements are:\n\n### 1. Install and maintain network security controls\n\nThis requirement now specifies “network security controls” instead of “firewalls”, to cover more network security technologies. All of the sections in this category have been changed to the following:\n\n* 1.1 Processes and mechanisms for installing and maintaining network security controls are defined and understood.\n* 1.2 Network security controls (NSCs) are configured and maintained.\n* 1.3 Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted.\n* 1.4 Network connections between trusted and untrusted networks are controlled.\n* 1.5 Risks to the CDE from computing devices that are able to connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE are mitigated.\n\n### 2. Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components\n\nThis requirement was initially named “Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.”. Now, it refers to all of the company’s configurations, and not only to using vendor-supplied defaults. The sections in this category are the following:\n\n* 2.1 Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.\n* 2.2 System components are configured and managed securely.\n* 2.3 Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.\n\n### 3. Protect Stored Account Data\n\nWith the third requirement, the focus is switched to account data, compared to the old version, where “cardholder data\" was mentioned instead. New sections are added in relation to PAN (Primary Account Number) and SAD (Sensitive Authentication Data) which cover the storage, encryption and hashing of this data.\n\n* 3.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.\n* 3.2 Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.\n* 3.3 Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.\n* 3.4 Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy cardholder data are restricted.\n* 3.5 Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.\n* 3.6 Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.\n* 3.7 Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key lifecycle are defined and implemented.\n\n### 4. Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public Networks\n\n“Strong cryptography” is now part of the 4th requirement name, to highlight the importance of using appropriate algorithms. The new sections introduce rules regarding the storage and usage of keys and certificates. \n\n* 4.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are defined and documented.  \n* 4.2 PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission. \n\n### 5. Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software \n\nThis requirement has been renamed, replacing “anti-virus” with “malicious” software to cover a broader range of technologies. Moreover, sections in this category now regulate the frequency of scans and checks, as well as other aspects.\n\n* 5.1 Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.\n* 5.2 Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.\n* 5.3 Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.\n* 5.4 Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.\n\n### 6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software\n\nIn this requirement, one of the new sections added (6.4) refers to automating the detection and prevention of attacks over public-facing web apps. Sections 6.1 and 6.3 also contain new requirements.\n\n* 6.1 Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.\n* 6.2 Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.\n* 6.3 Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.\n* 6.4 Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.\n* 6.5 Changes to all system components are managed securely.\n\n### 7. Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know\n\nThis requirement includes new rules regarding the review of user accounts and their privileges, as well as the management and privileges of applications and system accounts.\n\n* 7.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and understood.\n* 7.2 Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.\n* 7.3 Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).\n\n### 8. Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components \n\nMany new sections regarding MFA, credentials and the entire authentication process have been added in this requirement. Two examples of changes that companies compliant with PCI DSS have to implement now are: the minimum length of a user account password has increased from 7 to 12 characters, and companies are not allowed to store passwords/passphrases in scripts or files.\n\n* 8.1 Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.\n* 8.2 User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.\n* 8.3 Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.\n* 8.4 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.\n* 8.5 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.\n* 8.6 Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.\n\n### 9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data \n\nThis requirement does not have many changes. Some sections that refer to roles and responsibilities, as well as the frequency of device inspections have been added.\n\n* 9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.\n* 9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.\n* 9.3 Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.\n* 9.4 Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.\n* 9.5 Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.\n\n### 10. Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data \n\nNew sections in this requirement regulate the automation of logging, prompt response to failed security controls, as well as how often logs should be reviewed:\n\n* 10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.\n* 10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.\n* 10.3 Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.\n* 10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.\n* 10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.\n* 10.6 Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.\n* 10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.\n\n### 11. Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly\n\nThis category includes the following:\n\n* a new requirement to manage all applicable vulnerabilities,\n* a new requirement to perform internal vulnerability scans via authenticated scanning,\n* a new requirement to deploy a change-and-tamper-detection mechanism to alert for unauthorized modifications to the HTTP headers and contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser, [according to PCI SSC](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r1.pdf).\n\nThe full list of the sections included in this requirement is:\n\n* 11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.\n* 11.2 Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.\n* 11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.\n* 11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.\n* 11.5 Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.\n* 11.6 Unauthorized changes on payment pages are detected and responded to.\n\n### 12. Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs\n\nThe title modification reflects that the focus is on organizational policies and programs. In PCI DSS version 4, requirements specify that the audited company should, at least every 12 months:\n\n* document and review cryptographic cipher suites and protocols,\n* review hardware and software components,\n* document the PCI DSS scope,\n* review and update the security awareness program, among other requirements, which are presented below.\n\n \n\n* 12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.\n* 12.2 Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.\n* 12.3 Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.\n* 12.4 PCI DSS compliance is managed.\n* 12.5 PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.\n* 12.6 Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.\n* 12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.\n* 12.8 Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.\n* 12.9 Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.\n* 12.10 Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.\n\n## What do you have to do now? \n\nYou have to become PCI-DSS version 4 certified until the 31st of March 2024. There are two possible paths for your company:\n\n1. Your company is already PCI-DSS certified, so until the first deadline you must cover some of the new requirements and until the last deadline all of them, or\n2. Your company is not PCI-DSS certified, so you have to start from the beginning with the new PCI-DSS version and fulfill all requirements according to the specified deadlines.\n\nThis new version of PCI DSS brings considerable changes, and the process of achieving compliance with PCI DSS can be long and cumbersome.\n\nCyscale helps companies accelerate their cloud compliance process and ace audits by providing:\n\n* security controls that check if you’re implementing the requirements correctly, and\n* a page for each standard where you can track your progress and history.\n"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Cyscale Ranked Among Top Ten in AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator","seoTitle":"Cyscale Ranked Among Top Ten in AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator","description":"AWS B2B SaaS Accelerator is a program launched by Amazon Web Services in collaboration with Vestbee that is meant to help support startups in their journey of developing innovations in different industries such as Cybersecurity, AI & Big Data, Financial Services & Insurance, Sustainability and ClimateTech, and others.
