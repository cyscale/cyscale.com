A message queue, in the context of the cloud, is a service used to temporarily store data before it is processed.  \n\nA message queue's role is to act like a buffer; if a service is too busy processing data and would otherwise drop traffic, then that traffic is added to a queue for temporary storage. \n\nA message queue usually works based on the FIFO mechanism. FIFO (First In, First Out) allows easy retrieval of messages based on their order of arrival to ensure a smooth process. That means the messages are extracted from the queue in the order they arrive. \n\n## Cloud vendors and queues \n\nLet’s look at solutions offered by cloud vendors and understand how to secure queues used in the cloud infrastructure. \n\n### 1. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) \n\nThis solution helps you manage distributed systems and asynchronous tasks by storing messages in a buffer and waiting until the system is ready to process them. A few of the benefits offered by Amazon through this service are: \n\n* Security, \n* Durability, \n* Availability,  \n* Scalability, and others. \n\n### 2. Azure Queue Storage \n\nAzure Queue Storage helps you store large volumes of messages that can be accessed using authenticated HTTP or HTTPS requests. This type of storage offered by Microsoft Azure is useful in managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring no data loss occurs. \n\n### 3. Cloud Tasks in GCP \n\nCloud Tasks is a slightly different service than we've discussed so far; GCP allows users to store asynchronous tasks in queues and easily manage them.  \n\nThis type of queue can be used as a task scheduling system since you can set a time when a task should be executed. \n\nHowever, even though the queues in Cloud Tasks are designed for tasks, message passing is a use case of the queues.  \n\nAnother solution, very similar to Cloud Tasks, is Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub is a message queueing system that functions on a predefined set of rules, where there is a set of Subscribers, who all receive the queued messages from the Publisher when an event occurs. \n\n## Queues in the Cloud - Best Practices \n\nWhen thinking about [data security in the cloud](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/), we think of secure storage and assets protection. For this reason, it is very easy to overlook where your sensitive data might end up; and queues are one place. \n\n**Don’t leave queues out of your data security program**; secure every state of data and ensure that you don’t have any vulnerabilities in your cloud infrastructure.  \n\nLet’s look at best practices for securing queues in the cloud. \n\n### 1. Encrypt the data that arrives in queues. \n\n[Encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) is critical in data security; it ensures that your traffic is confidential. \n\nWhether you implement client-side encryption (which means encrypting the data before sending it) or server-side encryption (where the cloud vendor deals with the encryption process), you need to ensure you don't have information in plain text. \n\nBesides these options, you can also make sure that, after leaving the queue, your data is stored encrypted. For example, AWS S3 assets allow users to set default encryption for data that arrives, so new objects are always stored encrypted.  \n\n### 2. Log actions that affect queues. \n\nKeep details of requests made to the queue; whether they are successful or failed, ensure you keep track of what happens to queues. Important signals that can help you identify any irregularities in your queues' configuration are:  \n\n* Authentication attempts,  \n* Latency, \n* Queue depth (the number of messages waiting to be processed), \n* Request and response sizes, and others. \n\nWhy are these parameters important? For example, if your cloud infrastructure is under a DDoS attack, you can quickly identify that by looking at requests and their size; such attacks usually send either very large volumes of data often or big requests that are meant to slow down your system. \n\n### 3. Restrict access to queue management and ensure access control \n\nImplement [the Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and only allow a small group of users to change queue configurations. Following [recommendations offered by Google](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/secure-queue-configuration), deploy specific roles like Queue Administrator and assign them only to users who require those roles. \n\nBesides management, you should also have in place good access control rules. For example, IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies that restrict unnecessary access should be implemented and applied to queues. \n\n### 4. Configure a dead-letter queue \n\nA dead-letter queue (DLQ) is a type of queue designed for messages that, for various reasons, cannot be stored in the queue and processed correctly. Some of the reasons why messages may end up in DLQs are: \n\n* The application in which the queue is used has logical errors, \n* The message length limit was exceeded, \n* The queue is full, and others. \n\nDead-letter queues are useful for debugging what went wrong with the messages’ processing. For example, using a DLQ, you can look at rejected messages and then redirect them to your main queues. \n\n### 5. Use private endpoints for your queues \n\nAlthough most cloud providers enable you to have storage assets (and queues) open to the internet, it is the safest to use private endpoints. \n\nThis can be done using a Private Link, which creates a private connection between the services in the cloud and the queue.  \n\nThis way, traffic does not unnecessarily reach the public internet, and a layer of security is added. \n\n### 6. Configure a good retention period \n\nThe retention period refers to how long messages are stored in the queue before they are deleted. **A longer retention period** is recommended to provide flexibility in your environment and allow some time between the moment a message is received and when it is processed. \n\nFor example, Amazon SQS lets you configure a retention period between 1 minute and 14 days. \n\n## Protect your data using Cyscale \n\nAfter understanding best practices regarding queue security, it’s time to ensure you’re implementing them.  \n\nYou can easily do this using Cyscale! We help you check if you have vulnerabilities in your cloud environment and quickly solve any findings to solidify [your cloud security posture](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/).  \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM","CNAPP"],"title":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","seoTitle":"Cloud-Native Security Tools for Multi-Cloud Environments","description":"As organizations continue to move their workloads to the cloud, security concerns have become a top priority for CISOs.

With multi-cloud environments becoming the new norm, cloud-native security tools have emerged as the go-to solutions for securing: \n\n* cloud infrastructures,  \n* cloud-native applications,  \n* and cloud services. \n\n## What is Cloud-Native Security and How Do You Achieve it? \n\nCloud-native security refers to security measures that are specifically designed to protect cloud-native environments. As organizations adopt cloud platforms, security vulnerabilities become more complex, and traditional security solutions are no longer capable of delivering reliable insights.  \n\nTo address these challenges, cloud-native security tools should be designed to: \n\n* provide real-time, [contextual alerts for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/blog/prevent-alert-fatigue/),  \n* help organizations meet compliance requirements, and \n* automate security processes. \n\nThrough targeted alerts, users obtain insights into their cloud computing infrastructure and can, contextually, see how misconfigurations impact their apps. Utilizing contextual alerting, security teams can easily identify and prioritize crown jewel assets and by cutting through the noise avoid the alert fatigue which is commonplace in most organizations. \n\nTo help meet compliance requirements, cloud-native tools provide auto-generated compliance reports, aiding companies with their audit process, as well as metrics to accurately measure the progress.  \n\nBy automating security processes, DevOps teams can streamline the software development lifecycle of their applications and shift their attention to important aspects. Risk caused by human error is reduced, and security policies are guaranteed to be consistently applied across all cloud environments. \n\n## Cloud-Native Security Tools in Multi-Cloud Environments \n\nAchieving complete security and compliance in multi-cloud environments is extremely challenging. It is time-consuming to correlate all assets, their relationships, and the risk attached to them across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP as each cloud provider comes with its own tools.  \n\nLet's look at the options companies currently have to secure their cloud: \n\nFor Microsoft Azure: \n\n* Azure Defender for Cloud,  \n* Azure Active Directory,  \n* Azure Firewall, and others. \n\nFor AWS (Amazon Web Services): \n\n* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), \n* AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), \n* AWS GuardDuty. \n\nFor GCP: \n\n* Google Cloud Security Command Center, \n* Google Cloud IAM, \n* Google Cloud Armor. \n\nHowever, these tools are typically designed to work within their own ecosystem. To cover multi-cloud systems and to obtain a clear understanding of each system’s security, a company needs a more comprehensive, purpose-built solution. \n\nThe answer to this problem is a centralized platform for managing application security across all environments. A [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)](https://cyscale.com/blog/cnapp-secure-native-applications/) is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications. It combines the following functionalities: \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management), \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management, and  \n* Container security. \n\nA CNAPP tool is capable of providing: \n\n1. Visibility, \n2. Security controls, \n3. Compliance features, \n4. Container image scanning,  \n5. [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp) assessments, and many others. \n\nA key advantage of CNAPP solutions is their ability to integrate with all cloud providers. This allows them to monitor cloud workloads and provide real-time alerts and remediation steps for their users. \n\n**Cyscale** is a [CNAPP tool](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) that brings together multi-cloud infrastructures and, using powerful dashboards and security controls automatically highlights misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, saving teams considerable time on remediation.  \n\nUsing this security platform, users can ensure that their cloud native technologies are in good hands. In the Cyscale app, you can find the following: \n\n* Over 400 controls across AWS, Azure, GCP that check for misconfigurations and contain remediation steps to safeguard sensitive data, \n* Powerful dashboards, such as the ones for Data Security, IAM, or Containers, \n* Many compliance frameworks with editable policies and metrics to track your company’s progress and help it in the audit process, and others. \n\nIn conclusion, cloud-native security tools are essential for maintaining cybersecurity in a multi-cloud environment and delivering a consistent risk-based view to the business."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","CSPM"],"title":"Secure Your Cloud Stack Now with our New Data Security E-book!

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* Microservices, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud resources, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product","CSPM"],"title":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","seoTitle":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","description":"Alert fatigue is a phenomenon in which individuals receive an overwhelming amount of alerts and become desensitized to them.

Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.png\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
