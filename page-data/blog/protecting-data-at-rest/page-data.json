Data at rest can be stored in: \n\n* Storage cloud assets such as buckets, \n* Databases, \n* Files, and others. \n\nThe most common method of protecting data at rest is through [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this article, we will look at ways to perform encryption and understand its importance. \n\n## Why is it important to encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are three main risks regarding data at rest: \n\n* loss,  \n* leakage,  \n* theft. \n\nIn all three cases, your data at rest will probably end up in somebody’s hands. You can forget your USB drive in a coffee shop, you can accidentally disclose your data to someone else or the public or it can be stolen by a malicious attacker. \n\nFor these reasons, a safeguarding mechanism is encrypting your data. \n\nWith this method, even if someone else gets ahold of your data, they will not be able to read it. \n\n## Client-side and server-side encryption \n\nClient-side encryption is done on a local device with the user's key. \n\nServer-side encryption is implemented in the cloud, and the cloud vendor usually takes care of the key. This method of encryption is easier to use, since the cloud provider takes care of the algorithm, the key management system, and other troubles you may have. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for client-side encryption, as well as solutions offered for server-side encryption.  \n\n## How do you encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are a few best practices that need to be considered when undergoing the encryption process: \n\n### 1. Use an industry-recommended standard with an appropriate key length. \n\nFor data at rest, symmetric encryption algorithms are usually used. An industry-recommended standard is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 2. Classify data and decide what to encrypt. \n\nMake sure you don’t leave any sensitive data unencrypted. Use [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) to decide what data should be encrypted.  \n\nAlternatively, perform full disk encryption to protect all data, especially in case you lose the hardware. \n\n## Key management \n\nNow that we’ve established how to encrypt data at rest, let’s talk keys.  \n\nIf your key management is poor, no matter how strong and well-done an encryption is, it can become totally useless. \n\nFollow the best practices we’re recommending to ensure textbook key management.  \n\n### 1. Use a random key generation algorithm for your keys.  \n\nMost random number generator algorithms are not truly random; they are called Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs).  \n\nIf you’re using programmatic functions such as random() or rand() from C++, Java, and other languages, you’re not generating random keys; they use a seed (which always gives the same result), can be predicted, and are not for cryptographic usage. \n\nFor this reason, you need to use tools that utilize Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs). \n\nTo generate a random, secure key, you can use: \n\n* [GenerateRandom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html), a tool provided by AWS, \n* the [GenerateRandomBytes](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/generate-random) API from GCP, \n* [SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html), a class from Java, and others. \n\n### 2. Store your keys separately from your ciphertext. \n\nDo not store your keys in the same place as encrypted data, and do not hardcode them in the source code. You can use: \n\n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware security modules (HSM), \n* key management systems such as Azure Key Vault and AWS KMS, \n* open source KMS such as HashiCorp Vault. \n\n### 3. Rotate the keys. \n\nChange the keys regularly (every 90 days or less). This process involves retiring an encryption key and generating a new one. \n\nMoreover, if a key is compromised, immediately replace it and assess which data is at risk. \n\n### 4. Implement access control for keys \n\nEnsure that access to keys is heavily restricted in the following ways: \n\n* [Implement the Least Privilege Principle.](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) Only the individuals that need the keys should be able to access them. You can also implement time windows when keys can be accessed. \n* Only authorized personnel should be able to access keys. Ensure that, after you’ve granted access rights to people, only they can see and use the keys. \n\n###  5. Manage key deletion \n\nIf a key is permanently deleted, all data encrypted with that key is lost. The key should be appropriately destroyed after all the encrypted data is decrypted and re-encrypted with a new key. \n\nSolutions from cloud vendors for safe key deletion are: \n\n* Soft delete in Azure Key Vault, \n* Key deletion scheduling in AWS. \n\n## Server-side encryption - cloud solutions \n\nAWS, Azure, and GCP provide data at rest encryption and key management solutions. Let's look at the available options and how to make sure you're using them correctly. \n\n### Encryption in AWS \n\nThe following services in AWS support data at rest encryption capabilities: \n\n* Amazon EBS, \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift, \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nKey management is done using the AWS Key Management Service, which allows users to utilize their own keys or let AWS deal with them. \n\n### Encryption in Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, users have the following options: \n\n* Azure Disk Encryption, for Virtual Machines, \n* Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database, which encrypt all data at rest. \n\nFor key management, Azure provides the following services: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM). \n\n### Encryption in GCP \n\nFor key management, GCP provides the Google Key Management Service. As an additional layer of security, the encryption key, named DEK (Data Encryption Key), is also encrypted using a KEK (Key-encryption key).  \n\n## How do you check for encryption misconfigurations? \n\nAs we’ve seen, there are many best practices to be considered, and therefore there is room for mistakes. \n\nYou can quickly [check for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) regarding data at rest encryption in the cloud using Cyscale’s controls. Here are a few examples of controls that check if you’re implementing the best practices described in this article: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure storage for critical data are encrypted with Customer Managed Key* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure EBS encryption by default is enabled* for AWS, \n* *Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest* for AWS. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","seoTitle":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","description":"CNAPP is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications.

A [cloud-native application](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) is an application that is intended for cloud, ran and hosted in the cloud. \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:  \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management),  \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management), and \n* Containers Security. \n\nIn this article, we will understand what features a CNAPP has, and why it is a necessary tool for protecting cloud-native applications. \n\n## Why is CNAPP needed?  \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture than non-native applications, it is essential to understand the key features cloud-native applications have and the security concerns that come with them. \n\n**How is the infrastructure different?** Cloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes, which can increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but can also introduce new concerns in terms of security.  \n\nThese types of applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs. \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP solution is necessary to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.  \n\nLet’s understand some of the features CNAPP solutions provide to secure cloud-native applications. \n\n### 1. Visibility\n\nContext-aware visibility is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Because of the complex nature of cloud-native applications, it can become challenging to understand issues regarding the underlying infrastructure. Visibility is ensured in CSPM platforms. \n\nFor example, even though microservices communicate with each other and the application is functioning correctly, vulnerabilities may still exist. A misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access.  \n\nTherefore, visibility features in CNAPP are important to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between cloud assets, applications and systems and automatically pinpoints security issues. [The graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities and provide visibility in your cloud environment. \n\n### 2. Security controls\n\nManually going through every cloud asset and configuration to check for vulnerabilities is not only a difficult task, but it can also become impossible in large cloud environments in which thousands of assets are in use.  \n\nTo solve this problem, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and provide guidance for remediating found issues. This mechanism saves time and reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP. \n\nFor example, you can see a control from the Cyscale platform in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-1-control.png\" alt=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nIn Cyscale, you can find a collection of over 300 controls that check services across multiple cloud vendors and provide remediation steps for findings. \n\nWhen an asset does not pass a control, an alert is generated.  \n\nTargeted alerts that highlight vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a cloud environment are crucial; reacting to and fixing findings quickly can save a company from a breach. \n\nHowever, alert fatigue is a real problem that security teams deal with; receiving too many alerts can lead to security professionals ignoring important alerts. A good CNAPP solution deals with all of these problems and provides a sound alert system.  \n\nFor example, in the image below, you can see an alert that has been triggered. Alerts can be Open or Resolved, to indicate if the issue that generated the alert has been fixed. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-2-alert.png\" alt=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\n### 3. Data security \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications, data security is a critical concern in companies administering them. By scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be exposed. \n\nUsing a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/), data security can be achieved for cloud-native applications. Security controls, as discussed in the previous section, enable organizations to identify misconfigurations or non-compliance with data security best practices in their cloud assets. \n\nIt is recommended that: \n\n* [At rest and in transit data are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/),  \n* Assets are not publicly accessible unless it is necessary, \n* Encryption keys are managed correctly in their entire lifecycle, and others. \n\nFor each of these best practices and more, Cyscale offers a wide variety of controls that cover AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies*, \n* *Ensure databases are not publicly accessible*, \n* *Ensure that Encryption key is rotated*. \n\nMoreover, in Cyscale, you can find a [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and encryption keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities. \n\n### 4. Compliance \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their [compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/) journey. The CSPM ([Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/)) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet various compliance frameworks.  \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to prepare for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards are: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR, \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/). \n\nCyscale supports all of them and more. You can view all supported standards on the Standards page, enable or disable frameworks, track progress with your compliance process, and view the cloud-focused requirements and associated controls for each of the standards.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-3-compliance.png\" alt=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\n### 5. Container image scanning  \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.  \n\nFor example, if a container image uses **an unpatched version of Log4J**, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications running in that container. \n\n### 6. Cloud workloads protection \n\nCWPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/) and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them. \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes: \n\n* VMs,  \n* Containers,  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### 7. Kubernetes Cluster inspection \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It contains the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining, for example, which application is running in which container. \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior. \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are: \n\n* Unauthorized access,  \n* Missing patches,  \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### 8. IAM\n\n[IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) is another essential component of cloud-native applications security, specific to a CIEM platform. With complex cloud environments, it can become challenging to keep track of users, their different access levels, what impact certain permissions have, and so on. \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to the following aspects, but not limited to: \n\n1. Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making it more difficult to manage IAM. \n2. Cloud-native software is built to run in cloud environments, in multi-cloud as well as on-premises. \n3. The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing IAM identities at the service level. \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to secure their cloud in terms of IAM and manage identities.  \n\nSome best practices regarding IAM are: \n\n* **Implement multi-factor authentication for all users.** This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification. \n* **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity. \n* **Comply with the Least Privilege Principle** to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary. \n* **Assign permissions at group level** and assign very well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches. \n\nYou can read more about securing IAM in the cloud [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nTo ensure a deep understanding of user permissions and their impact, Cyscale provides an [Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-4-iam.png\" alt=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to their dynamic nature, their high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient. \n\nCNAPP solutions offer: \n\n* Visibility, \n* Compliance, \n* Data security, \n* Runtime protection, \n* Container image scanning, \n* Kubernetes cluster inspection, \n* IAM, and others. \n\nUse Cyscale to benefit from these features and secure your cloud environment! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance"],"title":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud","description":"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Technology Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines is a set of principles and best practices destined for financial institutions, meant to regulate risk management and assessment, access control, incident management, software application development, and others.

High availability is an essential feature, and having disruptions of even a few minutes per week can cost organizations a lot. \n\n**Recoverability** is the ability of an organization to quickly restore its systems after an incident. **Disaster recovery** is an aspect of recoverability that specifically refers to the way systems and data are restored after a disaster.  \n\n**System backup** is the process of storing copies of data in different data centers. Backup goes hand-in-hand with **data center resilience**, enforcing that data backups should be stored in data centers that are in different regions. In this way, if a natural disaster or civil unrest occurs, the destructions of all backups may be avoided by storing them apart.  \n\n## Access control \n\nThe following section in MAS TRM Guidelines is access control. It is a component of IAM (Identity and Access Management) that describes what users can access and how. Parts of this section include: \n\n* User access management, \n* Privileged access management. \n\n**User access management** refers to what resource can each user access. [The principles of least privilege](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) and segregation of duties are recommended best practices. \n\n**Privileged Access Management (PAM)**, on the other hand, is an essential aspect of access control that strictly regulates the access of authorized users to privileged resources. Moreover, the access granted can be restricted: the user may only access important resources for a limited amount of time or perform only a small set of actions, according to their needs. \n\n## Cryptography \n\n[Cryptography](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/) protects the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of mostly at-rest and in-transit data.  \n\nIn MAS TRM Guidelines, two aspects of cryptography are considered: \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol, \n* Cryptographic Key Management. \n\n**Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol** refers to the usage of industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms, such as: \n\n* SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for in transit data encryption, and  \n* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for [at rest data](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-data-at-rest/) encryption. \n\n**Key management** is also an important aspect of cryptography; if the key is not generated, stored, transmitted, or destroyed safely, it may compromise the encryption. Best practices that we recommend include: \n\n* generating the keys randomly,  \n* rotating them regularly,  \n* storing them separately from ciphertext. \n\n## Data and Infrastructure Security \n\nThis section refers to the following concepts: \n\n* Data Security, \n* Network Security, \n* System security, \n* Virtualization security. \n\nTo ensure **data security**, data should be protected in all its states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Unauthorized access, modification, copying, or destruction of data should be avoided by: \n\n* Encrypting data when possible, \n* Disabling public access to assets that should not be publicly accessible, \n* Restricting access through strict policies, and others. \n\nTo implement **network security**, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network access control lists (ACLs), and other network devices or protection mechanisms should be used. \n\nTo ensure a strong **system security**, recommendations from MAS TRM Guidelines include both software and hardware components in their best practices: \n\n* using anti-virus programs for endpoint protection,  \n* defining procedures to check if security measures are effective and up to date, \n* using a white-list approach, which means that only authorized software should be trusted, and others. \n\nLastly, best practices suggested by MAS TRM Guidelines in the context of virtualization security are: \n\n* Implement a strong access control to administrative privileges that may affect the hypervisor or the operating system of a virtual machine (VM),  \n* Ensure the images used for VMs are secure, and others. \n\n## Cyber Security Operations \n\nThe “**Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection**” component refers to continuous logging and monitoring of cloud processes to identify suspicious behavior and anomalies, as well as procedures that should be implemented to efficiently react to findings. \n\n## Cyber Security Assessment \n\nThe last section that can be applied to cloud environments is \"Cyber Security Assessment\", more specifically, **Vulnerability assessment**.  \n\nTo identify vulnerabilities in the cloud, regular vulnerability assessments should be conducted.  \n\n## Achieving MAS TRM Compliance in the Cloud \n\nMAS TRM Guidelines is a comprehensive compliance standard that specifies best practices for financial institutions. We've looked at aspects that affect cloud environments. \n\nCyscale provides a dedicated page for standards and compliance laws, that can be used to track progress in the compliance process and ensure that you’re ready for audits. MAS TRM Guidelines is one of the compliance frameworks that can be found here. \n\nIn the image below, you can see that, for the standard, there have been 268 controls checked, which are available across four cloud vendors (Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP Cloud, Alibaba Cloud). \n\n<img src=\"/img/33_blog-mas-standard.png\" alt=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"MAS TRM in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:autorem;height:autorem;\"/>\n\nLet’s look at examples of controls for some of the key components we've described in this article to see how Cyscale checks cloud configurations and helps you understand which requirements you’re fulfilling and which not. \n\n### IT Resilience \n\n* Availability: *Ensure databases have deletion protection enabled.* \n* Backups: *Ensure soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage.* \n\n### Access control \n\n* User access management: *Ensure IAM policies that allow full \"\\*:\\*\" administrative privileges are not created.* \n* Privileged access management: *Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for usage of \"root\" account.* \n\n### Cryptography \n\n* Cryptographic Algorithm and Protocol: *Ensure web app is using the latest version of TLS encryption.* \n* Cryptographic Key Management: *Ensure Azure Key Vaults are used to store secrets.* \n\n### Data and Infrastructure Security \n\n* Data security: *Ensure databases are encrypted.* \n* Network security: *Ensure firewall rule does not allow all traffic on port 80.* \n* System Security: *Ensure Kubernetes Engine uses HTTP load balancing ID.* \n* Virtualization security: *Ensure AMIs Are Private.* This control limits data exposure by disabling public access to AMIs (Amazon Machine Images). \n\n### Cyber Security Operations \n\n* Cyber Event Monitoring and Detection: *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions.* \n\n### Cyber Security Assessment \n\n* Vulnerability assessment: *Ensure AWS Inspector is configured for EC2 Instances.* \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News"],"title":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","seoTitle":"Announcing the New Whitepaper: The In-Depth Guide to Cloud Compliance in 2023","description":"Along with the new year come new resolutions.

Still, companies outside this range also choose to become NIST compliant due to the excellent reputation and benefits of the standard. \n\nThree NIST frameworks can be used when establishing NIST compliance: \n\n* NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* NIST 800-53, \n* NIST 800-171. \n\nLet’s look at them in detail to understand the differences. \n\n## NIST Cybersecurity Framework \n\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) gathers best practices and standards to help companies build a robust cybersecurity program and manage risk.  \n\nThe framework contains 5 core functions, which contain 23 categories, which in turn are divided into 108 subcategories formulated as outcomes. Organizations can formulate their own controls or use the suggested ones corresponding to NIST SP 800-53.  \n\nThe core functions are: \n\n* Identify, \n* Protect, \n* Detect, \n* Respond, \n* Recovery. \n\nThe **Identify** function focuses on the company’s efforts to assess and understand: \n\n* Risk, \n* The business environment,  \n* Assets, \n* The supply chain, and others. \n\nIdentify is the first step to securing your cloud environment; having a good grasp of your assets and their relations can provide you the visibility you need to secure them and fix misconfigurations properly. \n\nThe **Protect** function introduces requirements regarding: \n\n* [identity management](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/),  \n* access control,  \n* data security, and others. \n\nWe can translate to the cloud this function’s scope through the following examples: \n\n* Assets [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/), \n* Strong [IAM policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/), \n* Compliance with the [Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), and others. \n\nThe third function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, **Detect**, refers to the logging and monitoring of processes and events. Suspicious behavior and anomalies can be identified through careful examination of logs. \n\nThe **Respond** function involves incident management and incident response and ensures that the impact of a cybersecurity incident is minimized. \n\nThe last step to ensuring NIST CSF compliance is **Recovery**. Availability is crucial, and incidents that keep systems down can be catastrophic. To fulfill this function in the cloud, one of the solutions is to replicate and back up data in different data centers and regions to safeguard data and maintain high availability in the case of incidents. \n\n## NIST 800-53 \n\nThe NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 is a comprehensive framework designed for governmental agencies that implement information security systems, except for those related to national security, where they can be used to complement the national security systems guidelines. \n\nSP 800-53 has over 1000 security controls, categorized into the following 20 control families: \n\n1. Access control, \n2. Awareness and training, \n3. Audit and accountability, \n4. Assessment, authorization, and monitoring, \n5. Configuration management, \n6. Contingency planning, \n7. Identification and authentication, \n8. Incident response, \n9. Maintenance, \n10. Media protection, \n11. Physical and environmental protection, \n12. Planning, \n13. Program management, \n14. Personnel security, \n15. [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) processing and transparency, \n16. Risk assessment, \n17. System and services acquisition, \n18. System and communications protection, \n19. System and information integrity, \n20. Supply chain risk management. \n\nFor this framework, the following steps are recommended: \n\n1. **Analyze.** This stage involves understanding what data the company stores and the risk associated with it, as well as possible threats. \n2. **Tailor controls.** This process involves inspecting all of the controls and establishing how each of them applies to your company, as well as adjusting them to fit your company's needs.  \n3. **Assess.** A continuous analysis of the efficacy is an essential process. \n\nFor example, the first control family described in NIST SP 800-53, “Access control”, can be comprised of several cloud-specific requirements, such as: \n\n* Assigning permissions in the cloud at group level with well-defined rules, \n* Using role-based access control (RBAC) and complying with the Least Privilege Principle, \n* Enabling [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-best-practices-from-aws-azure-gcp/#MFA) for all users, and others. \n\n## NIST 800-171 \n\nThe NIST SP 800-171 is a framework designed for non-federal companies that work with federal agencies. This framework is intended to protect controlled unclassified information (CUI). \n\nCUI is information related to the government that is unclassified, but sensitive. For example, [PII](https://cyscale.com/blog/protecting-pii-in-the-cloud/) and [PHI](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/) may fall under this category. \n\nThis framework contains 14 out of the 20 categories listed for NIST 800-53 and is less complex than SP 800-53. Many of the 110 controls are best practices and are easier to understand, compared to the 1000 controls existent in NIST SP 800-53. \n\n## Here’s how we can help \n\nChoosing which framework is suitable for you and becoming compliant is not an easy task.  \n\nCyscale can help you ease the process of becoming NIST compliant. Using our Standards page, you can track your progress and speed up the process in terms of your cloud-specific needs. \n\n<img src=\"/img/32_blog-standards.png\" alt=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" title=\"The NIST Standard in Cyscale\" class=\"\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
