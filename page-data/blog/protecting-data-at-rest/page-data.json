Data at rest can be stored in: \n\n* Storage cloud assets such as buckets, \n* Databases, \n* Files, and others. \n\nThe most common method of protecting data at rest is through [encryption](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). In this article, we will look at ways to perform encryption and understand its importance. \n\n## Why is it important to encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are three main risks regarding data at rest: \n\n* loss,  \n* leakage,  \n* theft. \n\nIn all three cases, your data at rest will probably end up in somebody’s hands. You can forget your USB drive in a coffee shop, you can accidentally disclose your data to someone else or the public or it can be stolen by a malicious attacker. \n\nFor these reasons, a safeguarding mechanism is encrypting your data. \n\nWith this method, even if someone else gets ahold of your data, they will not be able to read it. \n\n## Client-side and server-side encryption \n\nClient-side encryption is done on a local device with the user's key. \n\nServer-side encryption is implemented in the cloud, and the cloud vendor usually takes care of the key. This method of encryption is easier to use, since the cloud provider takes care of the algorithm, the key management system, and other troubles you may have. \n\nIn this article, we will look at best practices for client-side encryption, as well as solutions offered for server-side encryption.  \n\n## How do you encrypt data at rest? \n\nThere are a few best practices that need to be considered when undergoing the encryption process: \n\n### 1. Use an industry-recommended standard with an appropriate key length. \n\nFor data at rest, symmetric encryption algorithms are usually used. An industry-recommended standard is AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a key of 256 bits). \n\n### 2. Classify data and decide what to encrypt. \n\nMake sure you don’t leave any sensitive data unencrypted. Use [data classification](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-classification/) to decide what data should be encrypted.  \n\nAlternatively, perform full disk encryption to protect all data, especially in case you lose the hardware. \n\n## Key management \n\nNow that we’ve established how to encrypt data at rest, let’s talk keys.  \n\nIf your key management is poor, no matter how strong and well-done an encryption is, it can become totally useless. \n\nFollow the best practices we’re recommending to ensure textbook key management.  \n\n### 1. Use a random key generation algorithm for your keys.  \n\nMost random number generator algorithms are not truly random; they are called Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs).  \n\nIf you’re using programmatic functions such as random() or rand() from C++, Java, and other languages, you’re not generating random keys; they use a seed (which always gives the same result), can be predicted, and are not for cryptographic usage. \n\nFor this reason, you need to use tools that utilize Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generators (CSRNGs). \n\nTo generate a random, secure key, you can use: \n\n* [GenerateRandom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html), a tool provided by AWS, \n* the [GenerateRandomBytes](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/generate-random) API from GCP, \n* [SecureRandom](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/SecureRandom.html), a class from Java, and others. \n\n### 2. Store your keys separately from your ciphertext. \n\nDo not store your keys in the same place as encrypted data, and do not hardcode them in the source code. You can use: \n\n* dedicated hardware devices such as Hardware security modules (HSM), \n* key management systems such as Azure Key Vault and AWS KMS, \n* open source KMS such as HashiCorp Vault. \n\n### 3. Rotate the keys. \n\nChange the keys regularly (every 90 days or less). This process involves retiring an encryption key and generating a new one. \n\nMoreover, if a key is compromised, immediately replace it and assess which data is at risk. \n\n### 4. Implement access control for keys \n\nEnsure that access to keys is heavily restricted in the following ways: \n\n* [Implement the Least Privilege Principle.](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) Only the individuals that need the keys should be able to access them. You can also implement time windows when keys can be accessed. \n* Only authorized personnel should be able to access keys. Ensure that, after you’ve granted access rights to people, only they can see and use the keys. \n\n###  5. Manage key deletion \n\nIf a key is permanently deleted, all data encrypted with that key is lost. The key should be appropriately destroyed after all the encrypted data is decrypted and re-encrypted with a new key. \n\nSolutions from cloud vendors for safe key deletion are: \n\n* Soft delete in Azure Key Vault, \n* Key deletion scheduling in AWS. \n\n## Server-side encryption - cloud solutions \n\nAWS, Azure, and GCP provide data at rest encryption and key management solutions. Let's look at the available options and how to make sure you're using them correctly. \n\n### Encryption in AWS \n\nThe following services in AWS support data at rest encryption capabilities: \n\n* Amazon EBS, \n* Amazon S3,  \n* Amazon RDS,  \n* Amazon Redshift, \n* AWS Lambda, and many others. \n\nKey management is done using the AWS Key Management Service, which allows users to utilize their own keys or let AWS deal with them. \n\n### Encryption in Azure \n\nIn Microsoft Azure, users have the following options: \n\n* Azure Disk Encryption, for Virtual Machines, \n* Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database, which encrypt all data at rest. \n\nFor key management, Azure provides the following services: \n\n* Azure Key Vault, \n* Vault Managed Hardware Security Model (HSM). \n\n### Encryption in GCP \n\nFor key management, GCP provides the Google Key Management Service. As an additional layer of security, the encryption key, named DEK (Data Encryption Key), is also encrypted using a KEK (Key-encryption key).  \n\n## How do you check for encryption misconfigurations? \n\nAs we’ve seen, there are many best practices to be considered, and therefore there is room for mistakes. \n\nYou can quickly [check for misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-misconfigurations/) regarding data at rest encryption in the cloud using Cyscale’s controls. Here are a few examples of controls that check if you’re implementing the best practices described in this article: \n\n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at rest* for AWS \n* *Ensure storage for critical data are encrypted with Customer Managed Key* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure EBS encryption by default is enabled* for AWS, \n* *Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest* for AWS. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"},"suggestions":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CSPM"],"title":"Protecting Your Cloud-Native Infrastructure: How to Build a Comprehensive Security Plan ","seoTitle":"Protecting Your Cloud-Native Infrastructure: How to Build a Comprehensive Security Plan ","description":"As more organizations adopt a cloud-native approach to support their business operations, security may sometimes be left out of their initial plans.

Moreover, a [cloud-native infrastructure](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) requires a different methodology in terms of securing it, since it has unique characteristics such as: \n\n* Microservices, \n* Containers, \n* Serverless computing, and others. \n\nThese differences pose new security challenges, and in this article we will look at best practices for securing cloud-native environments and how to remediate any cybersecurity drifts. \n\n## Understanding your cloud-native infrastructure \n\nThe first step to building a comprehensive security plan is understanding every side of your cloud computing environment. This means that visibility is the first aspect we need to talk about.  \n\nVisibility is the foundation on which security is built. Without visibility into your infrastructure, you cannot effectively secure your cloud resources, monitor for threats, detect anomalies, or respond to incidents. \n\nFor example, with microservices and containers, it can be challenging to maintain visibility, as these components are constantly changing and evolving. \n\nTo achieve visibility, you need to establish an inventory of all cloud resources, understand their relationships and how they are situated in relation to the Internet, as well as continuously monitor them to understand normal behavior. At the end of the article, we explain how this tedious process can be resolved very efficiently. \n\n## Assessing your infrastructure \n\nAfter gaining visibility into your infrastructure, it’s time to thoroughly check your resources for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.  \n\nWe’ve comprised a list of common misconfigurations in cloud-native environments: \n\n### 1. Incorrect container configurations \n\nThis is a broad category that includes: \n\n* overly permissive container privileges,  \n* unpatched vulnerabilities,  \n* poor access control, and others. \n\nRunning containers with excessive permissions, such as root, can lead to compromising the entire VM if the container is escaped. This misconfiguration is common because, by running a container as root, the administrator does not have to input their password for privileged actions. \n\nFailing to update and patch containers and their underlying operating systems can lead to critical attacks that expose your cloud infrastructure. \n\nPoor access control can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, as well as privilege escalation risks. Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains access to a low-privileged user and pivots to a higher-privileged user, possibly obtaining access to more resources and further attack paths. \n\n### 2. Missing or inadequate encryption \n\nEncryption is a must-have in your cloud security plan. Protect data in transit and at rest by encrypting it with industry-recommended cryptographic algorithms and by having a robust key management system. Read more about encryption best practices [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/). \n\n### 3. Unsecured storage resources \n\nUnencrypted storage volumes, misconfigured database permissions, buckets with public access enabled… there are many storage resources, and it's easy to lose track of them and their configurations. It's enough to allow public access to one cloud asset to compromise your entire environment if, for example, you're storing keys there.  \n\nSecure your storage resources by: \n\n* blocking public access to buckets using access lists and policies, \n* performing consistent backups and ensuring that those backups are stored in different geographical areas, \n* placing your databases in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and only allowing whitelisted IPs to connect to databases, and many others. \n\nWe have a [whitepaper about cloud storage misconfigurations](https://cyscale.com/whitepaper/cloud-storage-misconfigurations/) that goes into great detail on how to protect them. \n\n### 4. Improper network security \n\nNetwork security is a critical aspect of cloud-native security, as it helps to ensure that network traffic is appropriately filtered and secured. One of the key features of network security is Network Security Groups (NSGs).  \n\nNSGs are virtual firewalls that allow you to filter inbound and outbound traffic to and from your resources. They can be used to: \n\n* restrict access to specific ports and protocols, such as blocking access to SSH, \n* blocking traffic originating from certain IPs, \n* monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity. \n\n## Drawing conclusions and building an efficient plan \n\nIt’s easy to fall short when securing your cloud environment; we know how difficult it is to obtain contextual visibility, check all of your resources, and implement remediation as fast as possible. But we've got you covered. \n\nThese are the steps to secure your cloud-native infrastructure: \n\n* ensure you have good visibility over your environment, \n* fix all findings and reach a robust cloud security posture, \n* continuously monitor your infrastructure. \n\nUsing the Cyscale platform, you have access to several powerful dashboards that enable you to see, in real-time, your assets, their relationships, misconfigurations, as well as existing accounts and IAM permissions. Gain complete visibility using: \n\n* A general dashboard, with an overall view of the company’s cloud environments, as well as an asset inventory, \n* A [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities, \n* [An Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/), that helps users understand the impact of IAM permissions. \n\nBesides these dashboards, you have access to 400+ controls across multiple cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that check your entire infrastructure for misconfigurations. On top of this, you get remediation steps that help you adjust your settings in no time."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["News","Product","CSPM"],"title":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","seoTitle":"How to Prevent Alert Fatigue: Announcing the New Alert Features","description":"Alert fatigue is a phenomenon in which individuals receive an overwhelming amount of alerts and become desensitized to them.

Then, if a real cybersecurity event were to happen, they may not catch it in time, since alerts are not considered important anymore. \n\nTo avoid alert fatigue, a sound alert system with no noise is necessary. Knowing how to group alerts and how to manage them is very important. \n\nCyscale is a CSPM that provides solutions for alert fatigue and helps users understand their alerts. In this article, we will explain how. \n\n## Alerts visualization \n\nThe first step to managing alerts efficiently is understanding them. With the following four sections, you get to see how your company is handling the alerts at a glance. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-1-cards.png\" alt=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Alerts visualization cards in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe **Insights** card gives you context on how many alerts your assets have generated, as well as the average time to resolve them. This valuable information shows how efficiently the security team is working through findings. \n\nThe next section, **Summary**, shows how many alerts have a High severity and how many have a Medium severity, as well as other information about your environment. \n\nThe third card, **Trend**, illustrates the evolution of alerts over time. The time component, which is present in the first section as well, is key to fully understanding how well your company is progressing towards securing the cloud infrastructure over time. \n\nFinally, the fourth section, **Open Alerts by Asset Category**, shows the distribution of alerts over the types of assets in the cloud. For example, knowing that your IAM or your storage assets generate the most alerts can help you focus your attention on those areas of your cloud security posture. \n\n## Alerts grouping  \n\nThere are two views for alerts: \n\n1. Grouped by control, and \n2. An ungrouped list of all alerts. \n\n**The first view** makes alerts visualization more manageable by shortening the list and grouping the alerts by control.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-2-grouped-by-control.png\" alt=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alerts grouped by control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nThe result of this view is reducing alert fatigue by grouping the triggered alerts under a single item in the list. Each row represents one control, and in the fourth column, the user can see the total number of alerts, with a quick link to the affected assets. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-gif.gif\" alt=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" title=\"Seeing affected assets in the Cyscale platforrm\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nMoreover, this feature allows users to perform actions on multiple alerts through one click: for example, you can dismiss or acknowledge all alerts triggered by a control using this panel. \n\n**The second view** is a simplified view of the alerts. This is the old version of our Alerts dashboard, where you can search by alert and directly see details such as the severity, the status, or the affected asset.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-3-all-alerts.png\" alt=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"All alerts page in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts exemption \n\nUsing alert exemption, users can reduce the number of alerts and eliminate false positives. Generating an exemption is very easy and can be done straight from the alerts list. The exemptions are highlighted in the compliance reports to ensure visibility and help users understand: \n\n* why they were created, \n* who created them and why,  \n* when they were created. \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-4-create-exemptions.png\" alt=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Creating exemptions in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Alerts remediation \n\nIt’s never been easier to solve alerts than with the Cyscale platform!  \n\nBy clicking on the control that generated the alerts, a drawer with remediation steps appears. You don’t have to go through documentation and hours of trial and error – we give you the exact measures you have to take to fix your environment! \n\n<img src=\"/img/36_blog-5-remediation-steps.png\" alt=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Remediation steps in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the new features. Stay tuned for another set of improvements that bring more context to alerts! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["Compliance","News"],"title":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","seoTitle":"DORA Compliance in the Cloud","description":"DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) is a compliance standard destined for financial institutions that regulates operational risk management.

In this article, we will focus on that chapter to understand its impact on financial companies. \n\nMoreover, we will look at examples of security controls from the Cyscale platform that ensure cloud assets meet DORA compliance conditions. \n\nThe ICT risk management chapter has 12 articles, ranging from Article 5 to Article 16. \n\n### Article 5, Governance and organization \n\nThis article oversees that companies ensure: \n\n* availability,  \n* authenticity,  \n* integrity, and  \n* confidentiality of data. \n\nSome controls in Cyscale that ensure data security: \n\n* *Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users.* \n* *Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest.* \n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies.* \n\nBesides these requirements, roles, responsibilities, budgets, and other operational aspects are regulated in this article.  \n\n### Article 6, ICT risk management framework \n\nIn this article, [DORA requirements](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_6.html) include any strategies, policies, protocols, and tools that can be used to protect and secure computer software, hardware, servers, as well as physical components. \n\nSome examples of cloud-related features that can be added to meet this requirement are: \n\n1. [Bucket policies](https://cyscale.com/blog/s3-bucket-security/) that prevent unwanted read or write access,  \n2. Cryptographic protocols that encrypt data to ensure confidentiality,  \n3. RDS instances that are not publicly reachable, and others. \n\nOther conditions are also specified in this article, such as how often implementations should be documented and reviewed, how audits should be performed, and others. \n\n### Article 7, ICT systems, protocols and tools \n\nThis section in DORA is related to ICT systems, protocols, and tools and how they should be regularly updated, resilient, reliable, and performant enough. \n\nFrequently updating the applications, operating systems, and technologies cloud security teams use is essential in keeping the cloud secure.  \n\nCyscale helps you ensure you’re compliant with Article 7. An example of control is *Ensure that the latest OS Patches for all Virtual Machines are applied.* \n\n### Article 9, Protection and prevention \n\nContinuous logging and monitoring are an essential component of every cloud security program, and it’s not neglected in DORA. Observing anomalies and identifying suspicious behavior early can save a company’s systems from malicious attacks. \n\nBesides logging, this article reiterates the importance of availability, [authenticity](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/), integrity, and confidentiality of data in all of its states.  \n\nMoreover, DORA requires that: \n\n* You minimize the risk of corruption or loss of data. \n* You prevent unauthorized access, \n* You ensure that data is protected from human error or poor administration. \n\n[The Least Privilege Principle](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/) is a starting point to ensure these three conditions. Users should only have the necessary privileges for a limited amount of time. \n\n### Article 10, Detection \n\nThis article reinforces the importance of logging and monitoring.  \n\nCyscale provides cloud-focused controls for [AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba](https://cyscale.com/use-cases/cloud-data-security/) that check if you have logging enabled in your cloud infrastructure. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions* for AWS, \n* *Ensure that Activity Log Alert exists for Create or Update Network Security Group* for Microsoft Azure, \n* *Ensure log metric filter and alerts exist for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes* for GCP, \n* *Ensure Log Service is enabled for Container Service for Kubernetes* for Alibaba. \n\n### Article 12, Backup policies and procedures, restoration and recovery procedures and methods \n\nBackups that are logically and physically separated from your systems are required by DORA in the 12th article. \n\nA solution for backups in the cloud is availability zones. An availability zone is a geographical area where data centers are grouped. Storing your data in multiple availability zones provides redundancy and ensures that assets are protected in the case of disasters. \n\nIf, for example, electrical power was to fail in a large area, availability zones would protect you since they are physically separated.  \n\nBackup your cloud data often to ensure a quick restoration and recovery process in the case of disasters. \n\nCyscale helps you check if you have automated backups implemented with controls such as Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are configured with automated backups. \n\n### Article 16, Simplified ICT risk management framework \n\nSome institutions are exempted from articles 5-15: \n\n* Small and non-interconnected investment firms,  \n* Payment institutions exempted pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/2366, \n* Institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU in respect of which Member States have decided not to apply the option referred to in Article 2(4) of this Regulation, \n* Electronic money institutions exempted pursuant to Directive 2009/110/EC, \n* Small institutions for occupational retirement provision. \n\nAccording to [Article 16](https://www.digital-operational-resilience-act.com/Article_16.html), if your company fits in the previous list, this is the only article you should worry about. It defines the requirements you should follow when complying to DORA. The other articles should be disregarded. \n\nHowever, if you are in one of the mentioned categories, the same basic security principles still apply to your organization, such as: \n\n* [Ensuring availability, authenticity, and integrity of data,](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-data-security-guide/) \n* Continuously monitoring systems,  \n* Implementing backup and restoration procedures, and others. \n\n### Article 25, Testing of ICT tools and systems \n\nTo ensure that your cloud infrastructure is secure, it is recommended that you execute various tests, such as: \n\n* Vulnerability assessments and scans, \n* Network Security assessments,  \n* Software scans, and others. \n\nCyscale helps you provide proof of compliance with DORA for this article by scanning your system for misconfigurations and pinpointing which cloud assets are at fault.  \n\nMoreover, we provide remediation steps for findings to aid you in quickly solving any security issues your cloud environment may have.  \n\n \n\nCyscale has started preparing for DORA. Kickstart your compliance journey with us now and ensure a smooth process for DORA compliance. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"title":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","seoTitle":"CNAPP: The Key to Secure Cloud-Native Applications","description":"CNAPP is a security solution designed to protect cloud-native applications.

A [cloud-native application](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-native-security-guide/) is an application that is intended for cloud, ran and hosted in the cloud. \n\nA CNAPP combines multiple functionalities that are otherwise found in separate tools, including:  \n\n* CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management),  \n* CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform), \n* CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management), \n* KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management), and \n* Containers Security. \n\nIn this article, we will understand what features a CNAPP has, and why it is a necessary tool for protecting cloud-native applications. \n\n## Why is CNAPP needed?  \n\nSince cloud-native applications are designed using a different architecture than non-native applications, it is essential to understand the key features cloud-native applications have and the security concerns that come with them. \n\n**How is the infrastructure different?** Cloud-native software is built in containerized environments, such as those managed with Kubernetes, which can increase scalability and flexibility in the cloud, but can also introduce new concerns in terms of security.  \n\nThese types of applications are composed of microservices, which are components that communicate with each other through APIs. \n\nDue to the differences between native and non-native cloud applications, a CNAPP solution is necessary to cover the specific security needs of applications developed for the cloud.  \n\nLet’s understand some of the features CNAPP solutions provide to secure cloud-native applications. \n\n### 1. Visibility\n\nContext-aware visibility is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in cloud-native applications. Because of the complex nature of cloud-native applications, it can become challenging to understand issues regarding the underlying infrastructure. Visibility is ensured in CSPM platforms. \n\nFor example, even though microservices communicate with each other and the application is functioning correctly, vulnerabilities may still exist. A misconfigured API gateway that controls access to microservices may permit unauthorized access.  \n\nTherefore, visibility features in CNAPP are important to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the cloud-native infrastructure. \n\n[The Cyscale Security Knowledge Graph™](https://cyscale.com/products/security-knowledge-graph/) is an all-inclusive graph that provides correlations between cloud assets, applications and systems and automatically pinpoints security issues. [The graph](https://cyscale.com/blog/security-knowledge-graph-integrations/) uses context to identify relevant vulnerabilities and provide visibility in your cloud environment. \n\n### 2. Security controls\n\nManually going through every cloud asset and configuration to check for vulnerabilities is not only a difficult task, but it can also become impossible in large cloud environments in which thousands of assets are in use.  \n\nTo solve this problem, automatic security controls are used to check for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and provide guidance for remediating found issues. This mechanism saves time and reduces the risk of human error, making it a crucial aspect of CNAPP. \n\nFor example, you can see a control from the Cyscale platform in the image below. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-1-control.png\" alt=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Control in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\nIn Cyscale, you can find a collection of over 300 controls that check services across multiple cloud vendors and provide remediation steps for findings. \n\nWhen an asset does not pass a control, an alert is generated.  \n\nTargeted alerts that highlight vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a cloud environment are crucial; reacting to and fixing findings quickly can save a company from a breach. \n\nHowever, alert fatigue is a real problem that security teams deal with; receiving too many alerts can lead to security professionals ignoring important alerts. A good CNAPP solution deals with all of these problems and provides a sound alert system.  \n\nFor example, in the image below, you can see an alert that has been triggered. Alerts can be Open or Resolved, to indicate if the issue that generated the alert has been fixed. \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-2-alert.png\" alt=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Alert in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 3. Data security \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of cloud-native applications, data security is a critical concern in companies administering them. By scaling up and down quickly, sensitive data may be exposed. \n\nUsing a [CNAPP solution](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/), data security can be achieved for cloud-native applications. Security controls, as discussed in the previous section, enable organizations to identify misconfigurations or non-compliance with data security best practices in their cloud assets. \n\nIt is recommended that: \n\n* [At rest and in transit data are encrypted](https://cyscale.com/blog/types-of-encryption/),  \n* Assets are not publicly accessible unless it is necessary, \n* Encryption keys are managed correctly in their entire lifecycle, and others. \n\nFor each of these best practices and more, Cyscale offers a wide variety of controls that cover AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and Alibaba Cloud. Some examples of controls are: \n\n* *Ensure object containers don't have permissive access policies*, \n* *Ensure databases are not publicly accessible*, \n* *Ensure that Encryption key is rotated*. \n\nMoreover, in Cyscale, you can find a [Data Security Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/data-security-dashboard/), which delivers a comprehensive view over data at rest storage assets and encryption keys, using DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) capabilities. \n\n### 4. Compliance \n\nCNAPP solutions help companies in their [compliance](https://cyscale.com/blog/cloud-security-and-compliance/) journey. The CSPM ([Cloud Security Posture Management](https://cyscale.com/blog/improve-cloud-security-posture/)) component of CNAPP provides reporting and policy management features that help companies meet various compliance frameworks.  \n\nTo become compliant, companies use CNAPP tools to prepare for audits. Some of the most popular accredited standards are: \n\n* [ISO 27001](https://cyscale.com/blog/new-iso27001-2022-version/),  \n* [SOC 2](https://cyscale.com/blog/soc-2-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* GDPR, \n* [PCI-DSS](https://cyscale.com/blog/pci-dss-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [HIPAA](https://cyscale.com/blog/hipaa-compliance-in-cloud/), \n* [NIST](https://cyscale.com/blog/nist-compliance-in-the-cloud/). \n\nCyscale supports all of them and more. You can view all supported standards on the Standards page, enable or disable frameworks, track progress with your compliance process, and view the cloud-focused requirements and associated controls for each of the standards.  \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-3-compliance.png\" alt=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"Compliance standards in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:0.0625rem;height:auto;\"/>\n\n### 5. Container image scanning  \n\nPart of the process of securing containers is image scanning. This is essential because it checks container images for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of deploying containers with security issues.  \n\nFor example, if a container image uses **an unpatched version of Log4J**, this could introduce a critical vulnerability in your cloud environment. It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the container, compromising the data and applications running in that container. \n\n### 6. Cloud workloads protection \n\nCWPP helps companies discover vulnerabilities and correlate them with cloud misconfigurations. Using a CWPP, you mitigate risk across multi-cloud environments by identifying vulnerabilities documented in [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/) and pinpointing which misconfigurations have exposed your cloud infrastructure to them. \n\nTo secure cloud-native applications, a CWPP tool analyzes: \n\n* VMs,  \n* Containers,  \n* Serverless functions, and others. \n\n### 7. Kubernetes Cluster inspection \n\nA cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run applications in containers. It contains the nodes and a control plane, which is responsible for the maintenance of the nodes, determining, for example, which application is running in which container. \n\nCluster inspection is a feature of Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) that provides visibility into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster by inspecting its configuration and runtime behavior. \n\nMisconfigurations that can be found using cluster inspection are: \n\n* Unauthorized access,  \n* Missing patches,  \n* Insecure network configurations, and others. \n\n### 8. IAM\n\n[IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/) is another essential component of cloud-native applications security, specific to a CIEM platform. With complex cloud environments, it can become challenging to keep track of users, their different access levels, what impact certain permissions have, and so on. \n\nFor cloud-native applications, IAM can become a very complex aspect of cloud security due to the following aspects, but not limited to: \n\n1. Cloud-native applications are highly scalable, and identities and access levels may change rapidly, making it more difficult to manage IAM. \n2. Cloud-native software is built to run in cloud environments, in multi-cloud as well as on-premises. \n3. The microservices architecture can increase the difficulty of managing IAM identities at the service level. \n\nCompanies can use a CNAPP solution to secure their cloud in terms of IAM and manage identities.  \n\nSome best practices regarding IAM are: \n\n* **Implement multi-factor authentication for all users.** This measure adds an additional layer of security by requesting at least two forms of identification. \n* **Use role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to sensitive data to authorized users and obtain high granularity. \n* **Comply with the Least Privilege Principle** to restrict access to the lowest privilege necessary. \n* **Assign permissions at group level** and assign very well-defined rules and privileges to groups. This decreases the risk of data breaches. \n\nYou can read more about securing IAM in the cloud [here](https://cyscale.com/blog/iam-services-in-aws-azure-gcp/). \n\nTo ensure a deep understanding of user permissions and their impact, Cyscale provides an [Identity Dashboard](https://cyscale.com/blog/check-for-least-privilege/). \n\n<img src=\"/img/34_blog-4-iam.png\" alt=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" title=\"The Identity Dashboard in the Cyscale platform\" class=\" blog-image-shadow \" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"/>\n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn conclusion, [CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) solutions](https://cyscale.com/products/cnapp/) are a critical security component for cloud-native applications. Due to their dynamic nature, their high scalability, and different architecture, traditional security measures may not be sufficient. \n\nCNAPP solutions offer: \n\n* Visibility, \n* Compliance, \n* Data security, \n* Runtime protection, \n* Container image scanning, \n* Kubernetes cluster inspection, \n* IAM, and others. \n\nUse Cyscale to benefit from these features and secure your cloud environment! \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"}}],"whitepaperCover":{"data":{"whitepaperCover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/4c8e8/whitepaper-cover-blog.png 111w","sizes":"111px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdbd5693af50ac8bf55f2d978315946c/891d3/whitepaper-cover-blog.webp 111w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"111px"}]},"width":111,"height":162}}}}},"blueBird":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png","srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/42463/cyscale-blue-bird.png 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/74bb1/cyscale-blue-bird.png 772w","sizes":"386px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e03ca/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 386w,\n/static/a7e41d4813d3dfc105b466b26564c454/e7f31/cyscale-blue-bird.webp 772w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"386px"}]},"width":386,"height":351}}}}},"compliceToolbox":{"data":{"blueBird":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/91b0f/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/d39b6/compliance-toolbox-blog.png 732w","sizes":"366px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/7257f/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 366w,\n/static/ff00ea5b4c39c823654efd65ff4bc449/a67bf/compliance-toolbox-blog.webp 732w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"366px"}]},"width":366,"height":333}}}}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2757132133","3765828210","4109069157","54043548"]}
