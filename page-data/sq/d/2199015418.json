In the realm of cloud security, IAM represents all of the measures and good practices implemented to prevent intruders from accessing cloud resources. \n\nAn organization's cloud environment may be in danger if authentication and authorization are not handled correctly. \n\nIAM, coupled with contextual security, is the recipe for success. Understanding the level of access for each user – as well as how that access impacts other assets – is vital. It may not seem like much if a user has read permissions over a storage account, but if that storage account contains sensitive data, such as credentials for another account, then the magnitude of the impact will surpass your initial assessment.

To fully understand how secure an asset is, you need to understand what users have permissions to interact with it and what resources it communicates with. It might seem that a VM is completely secure because you put it behind a firewall, but if a compromised user can access it, it’s game over. \n\nThe perfect recipe for contextual security is a Cloud Security Knowledge Graph. Based on it, we can represent in a visual and interactive way how cloud resources interact, what kind of relations they have, what users have permissions to read/write on them, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate my point, I will show you some scenarios where the difference between a secure cloud and a breach is made by fixing misconfigurations and limiting users' access. These measures are easier to identify using a graph, because it helps you understand the risks your environment is exposed to.
