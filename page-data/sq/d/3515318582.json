It is a complex tool meant to help IT professionals secure all the crevices of a cloud environment. Unlike traditional approaches to cloud security, which typically involve a lot of manual work and plenty of time spent putting together information about multiple tools and consoles, a CSPM offers real-time visibility into cloud infrastructure, a comprehensive view of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, an overview of the compliance stage and ongoing efforts, remediation solutions for findings, and many others.

ECS enables users to easily deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.  ECS provides the flexibility to choose between two launch types: EC2 and Fargate. With the EC2 launch type, containers are run on EC2 instances that you have to manage, while with Fargate, AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you only focus on deploying and scaling containers. AWS ECS is used for microservices architecture, batch processing, CI/CD, web apps.","date":"2023-06-23T06:15:18.782Z","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/43_blog-container-security-ecs.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/d6cae/43_blog-container-security-ecs.png","srcSet":"/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/ac644/43_blog-container-security-ecs.png 205w,\n/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/89b47/43_blog-container-security-ecs.png 410w,\n/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/d6cae/43_blog-container-security-ecs.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/913d0/43_blog-container-security-ecs.webp 205w,\n/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/91660/43_blog-container-security-ecs.webp 410w,\n/static/460fbae95deb1517b7c4e1488168c6b6/888e2/43_blog-container-security-ecs.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"permalink":"aws-ecs-container-security","featuredpost":true,"title":"Maximize Your Container Security: 7 Best Practices You Need to Know for AWS ECS"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"authors":"Sabrina Lupșan","categories":["CNAPP"],"description":"Container images are files that contain everything needed to run software on containers: code, system tools, libraries, runtime tools. Containers are a lightweight solution that allows applications to run independently of operating systems. Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies and provide numerous benefits, such as portability, consistency, scalability and isolation. Best practices include scanning your container images for vulnerabilities, hardening your container images, performing regular updates, using trusted base images and ensuring visibility in your cloud environment.","date":"2023-06-08T09:34:09.972Z","featuredimage":{"publicURL":"/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/43_blog-container-images.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/d6cae/43_blog-container-images.png","srcSet":"/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/ac644/43_blog-container-images.png 205w,\n/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/89b47/43_blog-container-images.png 410w,\n/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/d6cae/43_blog-container-images.png 820w","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/913d0/43_blog-container-images.webp 205w,\n/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/91660/43_blog-container-images.webp 410w,\n/static/d1dfbbfd6058b74725f481c5f50524be/888e2/43_blog-container-images.webp 820w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 820px) 820px, 100vw"}]},"width":820,"height":460}}},"permalink":"container-images-best-practices","featuredpost":true,"title":"Understanding Container Images: Common Vulnerabilities and Best Practices"}}}]}}}
